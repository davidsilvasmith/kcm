J. Todd Krajniak

CEO 
 
As an entrepreneur and business owner his entire adult life, Todd has developed a strong understanding that everyone has their own starting line in life but with support, encouragement and honest opportunity people will almost always strive to enjoy their maximum potential. 

After Todd’s 3rd year of attending Michigan State University, he left MSU to run the company he had started while attending MSU.  In his 30’s upon making the decision to transition into the financial industry, Todd made the conscious choice to pursue knowledge from mentors rather than to resume a conventional educational path such as earning a BS, MBA and/or CFA.

Todd’s life path through owning and managing companies, then seeking market knowledge through those who were proficient independent investors allows Todd to offer clients a “hands on” perspective with which some can empathize easier than those who possess a more conventional financial services perspective, which is crafted by experiences along an academic path.

As an organizational leader, Todd’s core people objectives surround creating and maintaining the virtuous circle where honest open ended opportunities are provided for individuals who want to personally prosper from doing good for honorable appreciative clients.

Outside KCM, Todd’s wife Cheri of 16 years and their three children keep the calendar full with all things that happen with a family.
