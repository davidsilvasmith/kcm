David Silva Smith

David started programming computers in the 7th grade. In high school for fun he spent freetime (and he had lots of it!) programming when he wasn't playing video games with friends.

David has a wide ranging experience in technology - from helping single person companies launch their websites (or mobile apps!) to servicing billion dollar organizations like Microsoft, Jackson National Life, State of Michigan, and Michigan State University.

David was also an early adopter and expert on bitcoin. He has been interviewed by [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/10/bitcoin-entrepreneurs-seek-mainstream-acceptance/3971121/), [CBS MoneyWatch](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/stocking-stuffer-of-the-times-bitcoin/), WKAR's [Current State](http://wkar.org/post/startup-grind-lansing-aims-give-entrepreneurs-boost), and [Bottom Line IT](http://justask.net/bottom-line-it-1-14-14/). In addition to being interviewed on bitcoin David has spoken [over a dozen times](http://www.bitcoinbulls.net/bitcoin-expert/educator/#bitcoin-speaking-experience) at bitcoin conferences around the world. Finally David Smith has written bitcoin articles that have been featured on [Benzinga](http://www.benzinga.com/author/david-smith) and syndicated to financial sites like Yahoo Finance.

Like [Todd](/contact/todd-krajniak/), Dave attended Michigan State (Go Green!) and Dave owns [Cognite Labs](http://www.cognitelabs.com], [Bitcoin Bulls](http://www.bitcoinbulls.net),  and [Moblizd](http://www.moblizd.com).

Outside KCM, Dave spends time playing with new technologies and playing with his young son. Favorites are Frisbee, basketball, and swimming.
