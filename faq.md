# What is KCM?

Krajniak Capital Management “KCM” also known as “KCM Managed Investment Strategies” is a fee only investment advisor registered with the State of Michigan. 

# The Origin of KCM

After a long period of self-reflection, I Todd Krajniak elected to expand KCM to the many who wish to move forward. It’s a gift of love to all who wish to respectfully join in. 
As an individual trader / investor there is a path we walk that if successful usually ends with the trader living a quiet, comfortable life. Some are able to embark on this journey with their own capital. Some have to raise money through investors.  Some structure a fund to raise their stake. In 2008, I launched KCM registering as an investment advisor focusing on emerging and undervalued companies.

At some point along the path, changes set in. The trader’s time frame changes. Often they become less active and focus on longer term positions morphing into investors; the word manager begins to stick.  Self-reflection begins to set in. There’s an awareness which develops as we cultivate this specific knowledge set; what do I do with it? As expected, most go quiet cleaving to their anonymity.  Many who cultivate the skillset of harvesting gains from the market tend to run simple discrete businesses taking care of those who trusted them early on.
My path into this skillset was unconventional at the kindest. I see the world through a frame of anguish, strife, moderated social responsibility and loathing for people who exploit those in less advantageous positions.  
From my life path I carry forward some core beliefs. These beliefs anchor the culture and mission of KCM. 

There are infinitely more great people than there are truly great opportunities. From personal experience as a small business owner prior to KCM, I know when you lift life’s boot off someone’s throat by providing them an honest opportunity, they run hard and fast with gratitude.

I believe in the need to create direct agenda over overlap when structuring professional relationships. 

I believe the most important aspect in a viable economy is the opportunity for workers at all levels to earn excess wages. When people have extra money, it ripples as they can afford to live life well. There’s not enough support for individuals to blossom and prosper in our economy.

I see every business as serving two customer bases; it’s an equation.  The first group receives valuable goods or services paying with money. The customers served by the entity on the other side of the equation receive valuable compensation paying with time and task. Good people have options to choose where they work.  It’s a virtuous cycle. The higher the quality of opportunities we can structure for people who contribute time and effort, the more there is to offer valued clients who receive valuable services.  

I believe it’s my job and everyone’s job to leave this world in a better condition than before we showed up.
So yes, I like many people in this business I will continue to serve the dear book of people who trusted me early. But because of my path, views and relationships cultivated along this path, I see much good that can be done if I KCM is opened as a gift of love for those who wish to participate.

# Who Does KCM Serve?

At the risk of sounding redundant KCM serves good people. Regulators want more specific words like individuals and high net individuals.  Hence; KCM serves individuals and high net individuals. In our mind we need to be able to look at a client and define them as a good person who simply wants a financial firm which is going to do a good job for them.  

# What KCM Does for People.

KCM sees the investing path as a path to autonomy.

## Core Asset Development: 

For clients under $25,000 the focus is on building core assets and learning their investing proclivities. Depending on the client’s risk profile we will create a simple blend of a large cap equity ETF and a fixed income ETF.  The communication focuses on bringing the client to become a knowledgeable investor who understands their life long investing path.
At $25,000 the conversation shifts toward broadening diversification and/or more targeted positioning to help clients meet their goals

## Managed ETF Strategies:

KCM offers 3 simple managed ETF strategies, Conservative, Moderate and Aggressive.  All three strategies are crafted with the goal of developing higher yield for the investor than which may be available commonly. Depending on the client’s risk tolerance and goals, these can be blended to meet most risk tolerance needs.

## Actively Managed Strategies

For certain investors who have a stronger desire for risk or a more targeted investment desire KCM offers the 4 Quadrant Managed IRA Strategy and the Compelling Opportunities Strategy.
The 4 Quadrant Managed IRA Strategy is available for risk tolerant investors who want an actively managed IRA strategy combining strongly aggressive strategies with the ability to move to conservative positioning depending on market dynamics.

The Compelling Opportunities Strategy goals are to maintain positive absolute returns across a longer span of time while finding emerging or out of favor companies which are on their way to becoming desirable to more conservative strategies. 

# Relationship Path

## Deliver Form ADV

Form ADV 2A and 2B are our firm’s required disclosure documents. They are delivered at the onset of a relationship, usually by email.

## Complete Investor Questionnaire

The Investor completes the risk tolerance questionnaire. This gives insight for tailoring the managed strategy to the Investor’s specific situation.

## Open Custodial Account

KCM uses third party custodians. The custodian has custody of the Investor’s cash and portfolio holdings. The custodian provides reports to the Investor. KCM manages the portfolio and implements decisions on behalf of the Investor through the third party custodian, but KCM never has the ability to withdraw or deposit funds to the customer’s accounts.

## Complete KCM Agreement

The Investor and KCM complete the investment supervisory agreement which outlines the terms of the relationship between the Investor and KCM.

## Effect the Investment Policy Statement

KCM drafts an investment policy statement which outlines specifically how the Investor’s funds will be managed. By signing the investment policy statement, the Investor acknowledges they understand and are in agreement with the parameters guiding the management of their portfolio.

## Fund Investor’s Custodial Account

The Investor either deposits new funds into their new account or ‘rolls over’ existing funds from another account into their new custodial account.

## Implement Strategy

After the account is funded and the documents are approved by KCM compliance, the Investor’s funds are “put to work” in accordance with the strategy outlined in the investment policy statement.

## Ongoing Contact

At the very least, Investors receive a quarterly email communique regarding their holdings and the third party custodian delivers account statements at least quarterly.  More frequent contact is always welcome and encouraged on an as needed basis.  For various life reasons there will be periods of frequent contact telephonically or in person initiated by either the Advisor or Investor.
