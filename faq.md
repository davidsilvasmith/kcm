# What is KCM?

Krajniak Capital Management “KCM” also known as “KCM Managed Investment Strategies” is a fee only investment advisor which registered with the State of Michigan in 2008. 

# Who Does KCM Serve? 

KCM serves good people. Regulators want more specific words like individuals and high net individuals.  Hence; KCM serves individuals and high net individuals. In our mind we need to be able to look at a client and define them as a good person who simply wants a financial firm which is going to do a good job for them.  

# Who Does KCM Hire?

At KCM “We’re all in this together.” means something. Plain and simple, we want people who’ve weathered life’s downturns maintaining their character and integrity. 

This business is a virtuous cycle.  Truly good people beget more truly good people. If at all possible, we will do what we can to find a fit for honorable individuals whose personal goal path and skill set overlap with KCM’s.

#What KCM Does for People?

KCM sees investing as a goal path toward autonomy. Everyone has a different starting point along the path, and different end goals as well.  Even so, much of the process in between the starting point and end goals is similar for all investors.
Once the investor’s path has been defined, KCM has multiple managed account strategies available to assist investors achieve their own objectives.

## Core Asset Development:

For clients under $25,000 the focus is on building core assets and learning their investing proclivities. Depending on the client’s risk profile we will create a simple blend of a large cap equity ETF and a fixed income ETF.  The communication focuses on bringing the client to become a knowledgeable investor who understands their life long investing path.

##Managed ETF Strategies:

At $25,000 the conversation shifts toward broadening diversification and/or more targeted positioning to help clients meet their goals
KCM offers 3 simple managed exchange traded fund ETF strategies: Conservative, Moderate and Aggressive.  All three strategies are crafted with the goal of developing higher yield for the investor than which may be available commonly. Depending on the client’s risk tolerance and goals, these can be blended to meet most risk tolerance needs.

##Actively Managed Strategies

For certain investors who have a stronger desire for risk or a more targeted investment desires, KCM offers the 4 Quadrant Managed IRA Strategy and the Compelling Opportunities Strategy.
The 4 Quadrant Managed IRA Strategy is available for risk tolerant investors who want an actively managed IRA strategy combining strongly aggressive strategies with the ability to move to conservative positioning depending on market dynamics.

The Compelling Opportunities Strategy goals are to maintain positive absolute returns across a longer span of time while finding emerging or out of favor companies which are on their way to becoming desirable to more conservative strategies. 

As a point of disclosure, there are legacy clients who are participating in either similar or entirely different strategies as outlined here.

###Individually Managed Accounts

As a fee only investment adviser, KCM is a fiduciary who must act in the best interest of our clients at all times.  To achieve this we utilize the service of third party custodians.

The third party custodian has custody of the client’s funds and securities.  The custodian is responsible for the financial reporting.  KCM makes decisions in conjunction or on the behalf of the client.

At times, this segmentation of tasks will seem a bit bureaucratic or extraneous, but the third party custodian managed account structure brings the client multiple protections.  The most notable being, your assets are in your own specific account and not with the assets of the firm making management decisions on your behalf. 



###Relationship Path

1. **Deliver Form ADV**
Form ADV 2A and 2B are our firm’s required disclosure documents. They are     delivered at the onset of a relationship, usually by email.
3. **Complete Investor Questionnaire**
The Investor completes the risk tolerance questionnaire. This gives insight for tailoring the managed strategy to the Investor’s specific situation.
3. **Open Custodial Account**
KCM uses third party custodians. The custodian has custody of the Investor’s cash and portfolio holdings. The custodian provides reports to the Investor. KCM manages the portfolio and implements decisions on behalf of the Investor through the third party custodian, but KCM never has the ability to withdraw or deposit funds to the customer’s accounts.
4. **Complete KCM Agreement**
The Investor and KCM complete the investment supervisory agreement which outlines the terms of the relationship between the Investor and KCM.
5. **Effect the Investment Policy Statement**
KCM drafts an investment policy statement which outlines specifically how the Investor’s funds will be managed. By signing the investment policy statement, the Investor acknowledges they understand and are in agreement with the parameters guiding the management of their portfolio.
6. **Fund Investor’s Custodial Account**
The Investor either deposits new funds into their new account or ‘rolls over’ existing funds from another account into their new custodial account.
7. **Implement Strategy**
After the account is funded and the documents are approved by KCM compliance, the Investor’s funds are “put to work” in accordance with the strategy outlined in the investment policy statement.
8. **Ongoing Contact**
At the very least, Investors receive a quarterly email communique regarding their holdings and the third party custodian delivers account statements at least quarterly.  More frequent contact is always welcome and encouraged on an as needed basis.  For various life reasons there will be periods of frequent contact telephonically or in person initiated by either the Advisor or Investor.
