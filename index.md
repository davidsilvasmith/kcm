##Providing Opportunity

As an individual trader / investor there is a path we walk that if successful usually ends with the trader living a quiet, comfortable life. Some are able to embark on this journey with their own capital. Some have to raise money through investors.  Some structure a fund to raise their stake. In 2008, I launched KCM registering as an investment advisor focusing on emerging and undervalued companies.

There are infinitely more great people than there are truly great opportunities. From personal experience as a small business owner prior to KCM, I know when you lift life’s boot off someone’s throat by providing them an honest opportunity, they run hard and fast with gratitude.
