##Recent History

Over the past month Central Banks have been taking turns adding money to the system to prop up the indexes.  This is being done for a myriad of reasons ranging from targeting certain financial outcomes, consumer confidence, and maintaining their own self-importance.

Strategies which move somewhat in sync to the indexes reported on TV have been the recipient of the collusive central bank efforts.  Strategies which focus on selecting investments based upon their individual ware withal are just recently finding their footing from the September / October sell off.

Over the past few sessions, positons have been beginning to stick.  It’s no longer a near 100% effort focusing on managing risk.  Now there is a feeling that other buyers are stepping into positions as well; deep value positions have been finding support instead of just selling further into absurdity.


##Central Banks vs The Business Cycle

Metals & Mining – Our reality.

In real life, if you buy a “thing”, it either started as a raw good or it was likely handled by machines that started as raw goods.  Following the price of stuff coming out of the ground used to make things and machine parts, it looks like us consumers have been buying fewer things.

S&P 500 – Our reality….. Mathematically adjusted by central banks to look good on TV.

As for the consumer class…. we are fixing the things we own.

But we are tepid in buying big shiny new things.

Because…….

To understand the business cycle one just needs to know, low prices cure low prices. Remember the $10,000 foreclosure bonanza a few years back? 

Central bankers seem more concerned with targeting self-validating narcissistic mathematical outcomes rather than fostering sustainably solid economic environments.  Narcissism of course, but unfortunately there are some gruesome realities driving their actions as well.

The conundrum; October was a warning shot.  QE ended and the market spoke.  If the central banks let the indexes and their closely correlated stocks embark upon price discovery, they are going to grapple with the realization that low prices are the only cure for low prices.

The path forward for the central banks is pretty tight.  They have to stay supportive of the large liquid indexes. If the S&P is allowed to trade off 40% or more, 80% funded pension funds become 60% funded overnight.  

Buy some futures now or backstop the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation?

[http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-22/veteran-sp-futures-trader-i-am-100-confident-central-banks-are-buying-sp-futures](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-22/veteran-sp-futures-trader-i-am-100-confident-central-banks-are-buying-sp-futures)

For the foreseeable future, it looks like the fed will find unfavorable results if they move interest rates. Nor can they step back from colluding with other central banks in propping the indexes.  This box trapping the fed continues until the business cycle drives earnings, wages and subsequent market inflows. 

How long will the banks have to support the indexes?? Don’t be surprised if they finally step back around the time the Millennials begin aggressively saving after paying for their kids weddings.
 

##Shortening Life Expectancy (Don’t count Ebola out.)

On the other side of the equation, reducing liabilities helps us get to the business cycle supporting the markets sooner. 
   
If we as a society reduce life expectancy from 75 to 68 that’s a 50% savings on social security.  Let that one sink in.   It’s not my logic, but it’s the operative logic today.  I enjoy my elders and hope to be one someday.

Fewer Baby Boomers means fewer social security recipients.  Fewer Gen X-ers making it to 65 means fewer social security recipients. It also means fewer people drawing down their accumulated assets and reducing defined benefit plan liabilities.  Reduce life expectancy from 75 to 68 and 80% funded pension plans suddenly become what??? …..110% funded plans??

Think this through:

If the goal were to provide great health care to all, then issuing a Medicare card to everyone who gets an earned income tax credit would have worked just dandy.
Don’t take this as an assault on one party over the other.  The Republicans have the power of the purse.  They haven’t defunded President Obama’s agenda.  Watch all their feet; this is theater.  

As someone who was pushed into the exchange last year from an 80/20 plan which worked, I can tell you the plans we have now are fraught with areas needing improvement.  And now that we have an increasing number of our population getting pushed into substandard options, ….
How does a government reduce Social Security and defined benefit liabilities?

Introduce ways for people to go back to God sooner than later.

The media blackout is keeping people calm.

But, cases are still growing.

Good people are working tirelessly.

Ebola likely won’t become the pandemic that the media wanted us to fret.  But, it might be a slow percolating sure thing which requires specific policies and procedures mandating elevated med tech spending.

There were a handful of microcap medical instrument and supplies companies which garnered significant interest during the media frenzy.  For KCM investors, we are revisiting them now that the stocks’ have purged much of their speculative froth.  After the initial glut of hazmat suit orders are filled, policy and procedure rewrites should require a higher level of hazmat inventory to be maintained at healthcare facilities throughout the world. 

As for the efforts of our policy makers.  I’m sad.


##Virgin Gold
Now there’s a headline.

[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-23/german-gold-stays-in-new-york-in-rebuff-to-euro-doubters.html](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-23/german-gold-stays-in-new-york-in-rebuff-to-euro-doubters.html) (It seems the US likely lent it out many times over)

Looking beyond the hype hoping to attract horror movie addicts to bolster financial TV ratings, the world is simply shifting away from the US Dollar as its primary reserve currency.  How does a nation gain respect for its currency?  Back it with gold.

If Germany quits trying to repatriate her gold because it seems the US couldn’t deliver it fast enough, where will other nations find enough gold to shore up their currency and what does that mean to investors?

From our stand point, gold is something to which we must pay attention, but it’s tricky to act upon well.  The US is aggressively taking actions to strengthen its currency through policy; reducing dependency on foreign energy, becoming an oil exporter and reducing entitlements through shortening life expectancy are a few.   

A stronger Dollar makes for weaker precious metal prices.  That works against buying physical gold.  Buying paper gold is more confusing.  If the Germans can’t get their gold back, how do you know if an ETF really has control of the gold it claims to represent?  

What does that leave? Virgin gold.  

For certain KCM investors we’ve initiated tiny positions in miners with the intent of adding more if the thesis solidifies.

##Resurrecting Henry Ford

We are starting to hear a gilded age populist media mantra develop.  “Wealth hasn’t been this concentrated since the great depression.”   Revolution!!!!!

What comes next isn’t a revolution.  It’s a resurrection of a lost economic idea.  Every business has 2 classes of customers.  The first set are obviously those who bring money to the business hoping to exchange money for goods or services which enhance their lives.  The second which gets overlooked, are the people who choose to bring their time and effort to the business in exchange for money.

Just like customers, employees choose to interact with a company.

In this world we have lots of stuff, but we have even more people who need money.

Henry Ford created the $5 a day wage because he needed people who would choose to spend their time at Henry Ford’s business. He also knew he needed workers who could afford to buy the products he made.

We are back there now.  The masses need businesses to sell them excess wages in exchange for the masses spending their time at the business.

In searching for ideas, keep in mind those who can put significant money in the pockets of the working class will become titans. 


##Going Forward

In recent monthly newsletters, I’ve discussed “Slow motion rotation”.  Some assets weren’t yet buyable.  Some have recently been sold but need to sell off much more.  Some aren’t yet ready to sell.  This is still the case.  

The Fed support of the indexes is on one hand concealing the correction from the masses who only see the nightly news which provides for confidence into Christmas shopping. But it makes the rotation painfully slow. 
 
We are now starting to see sectors which have sold off to deep valuation levels trying to hold support instead of continuing to drill further into absurdity.  Oil, gas, miners and coal seem to be in the process of attempting to purge the last of their sellers.

Managing risk in individual issues is still the overriding concern while continuing to establish and hold positions which are working. 
 
Be well,
