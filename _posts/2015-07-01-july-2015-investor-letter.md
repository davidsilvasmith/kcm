##Recent History

For a while now, we’ve been doing our best to keep portfolios very conservative.  The markets are much worse than the indexes featured on TV appear.    Portfolios where possible are holding high levels of cash. 
 
##Going Full Detroit

Keeping it pithy: Born in 70.  Lived in Detroit until 1978. Moved to 9 Mile.  Eminem’s 8 Mile is real close to home.  

The ’69 riots were the catalyst; white flight ensued.   It wasn’t white flight.  It was wealth flight that sent Detroit into its death spiral.  Those who could afford to move moved taking their taxable income and spending.  It left poorer, less educated people who continually voted for Coleman Young.  Incomes further eroded, taxes rose, more moved.  Oakland County landed the industrialists wealth.

What happens when water gets shut off to a neighborhood? Some agency takes back a whole bunch of unsellable homes while a municipality loses its tax base.  Bonds go unpaid. Pension shortfalls get shorter.  

Depleted aquifers settle; reclaiming infrastructure. The smart sell and move while there are still buyers.  The untaxable get trapped.  In good times, if CA is 20% short on precip water, they are at best 30% overpopulated.

Thirst always cures itself.

Some parched narcissists suggest a pipeline from Lake Michigan.   We welcome the years of political process which will accompany such a delusional dream.  The hope of a pipeline will keep the welfare-fed statists planted in CA tied to the crumble. Midwest candor is often diametrically opposed to PC dictates.

The industrious who empathize with Midwest candor and practicality are invited to move their businesses to Lansing MI. Housing here? $4,000 per month gets you 3,000 square feet on a golf course and lots of water.

Google Map Lansing MI and zoom out a bit.  You’ll see we are the blossoming central hub of post globalization North America.  If you are wondering who the TPP benefits….  Michigan State University is already 15% Chinese for a reason.  GM is relocating Camaro production here for a reason. We’ve got a ton of natural gas and we frequently have to defer mowing our lawns due to God given standing water.

If you are interested in information on relocating from the west to the Lansing area, give me a call.  I’ll do what I can to get you in contact with helpful people.   Rush hour is 20 cars at a light, this is a pretty tight community. 

##Peak Financial Engineering

Liquidity is synonymous with Human.  When industry people fret about the lack of liquidity, replace liquidity with the word “Humans”.   

The industry adopted a push for efficient alpha and predictably engineered financial outcomes; it’s at the expense of whom? Oh, we don’t care. We just want our alpha.  Until there’s no liquidity.  Once again, replace liquidity with humans and restate.   ….. *“Hey Wait!!! We are Human’s too?!!?”*

At first the HFT in 2011 came for the microcap, but no one cared because they didn’t trade microcap.  Now HFT dominate the indexes. Suddenly we have a chronic bubbling wail about the lack of liquidity.

CBOE who fully embraced the financial engineer has a chart which seems to be grappling with the "how do we bring humans back" problem.  They used to have human members and pits filled with human finger flippers wearing colorful blazers.  I wonder how many golf course buddies today’s HFT computer terminals bring in as customers?

KCM has no position in CBOE.

When the market chieftains design a market structure that fades and crushes all human discounting activity through the use of hyper trading and counterfeiting shares (sorry, “naked shares”), the humans quit trying and go home.

First one out gets to keep their money when the algos cannibalize themselves. CalPERS is fading complexity.  

*“The California Public Employees’ Retirement System this week [announced](http://fortune.com/2014/09/15/calpers-pension-manager-divesting-four-billion-hedge-funds/) that it no longer will invest in hedge funds, in an “effort to reduce complexity…..”         [http://fortune.com/2014/09/17/calpers-cuts-hedge-funds-is-private-equity-next/](http://fortune.com/2014/09/17/calpers-cuts-hedge-funds-is-private-equity-next/)*
 
##Move it, Mark it. Can’t Get Out.

The assault on zippy human money has been going on so long that many of the zippy humans are gone. The remainder now have been fairly well conditioned to hold through HFT gamesmanship.

In the small company space there’s a scenario brewing where companies with high short interests that have well survived their valley of death, have shareholders who seem to be unfazed by the antics of short funds.  The short sellers with their HFT can move the stocks, they can mark them, but they are finding themselves becoming trapped in an increasing amount of issues where they aren’t generating any noticeable selling either high or low in order to get their position covered.

The avenues available for the short sellers seem to be further increasing their position generating lower marks, digging themselves deeper while pushing off the day of reckoning, or hope to bleed out enough shares to cover over time before investors begin to rotate away from the hedge fund central bank tractor-beam favorite 50.  

When the funds expand their position to mark down the stock’s share price, ultimately they are placing more un-coverable shares into the hands of surviving humans who are now conditioned to sit through the gamesmanship.  When larger investors rotate away from the central bank tractor-beam stocks looking for new ideas, there’s likely going to be some head butting over available supply.

I can understand why an allocator would look at a description for generating alpha from expanding a stock’s short interest to manually drive down prices, then decide to limit complexity before complexity becomes complicated.  

Allocator:  “What about the companies that don’t delist?”

Manager: “We will work them”

Allocator;  “How many aging positions do we have?”

##HFT Cancer Work Around 

At first they came for the micro-cap.  Well it’s not just micro-cap anymore.  The destructive strategy of building of significant short positions and working the position with algos is metastasizing into higher quality companies now that the bones are getting picked clean in the lower rungs.  It’s a process which will eventually wane as companies on the whole realize the environment necessitates a more contemporary float management belief system which hand strings the ability of HFT’s to destroy.

In longs we have for our clients, it’s important that the companies have addressed or are addressing the nefarious HFT activity within the construct of their listing.   KCM has long positons in ANY and EFOI as both companies along with other criteria seem to have taken steps to fortify their shareholders from these unwarranted onslaughts.  Neither company are recommendations.

##Going Forward

For managed accounts we are conscious of the metastasizing intraday short selling HFT and the bloat and crush HFT strategies proliferating individual stocks and the indexes.  We are also very conscious of the repricing of debt.  This is leading to a blended mindset of principal preservation and positioning for where rotating funds will likely have to land.
