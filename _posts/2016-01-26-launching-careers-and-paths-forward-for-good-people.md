##KCM History
KCM has been in existence as a Registered Investment Adviser since 2008. For our investors we have brought a particularly unique perspective to investing in deep value and newly developing publicly traded companies.  This unique perspective in analyzing an investment’s potential comes from my business entrepreneurial path. 

##Tackling Some of Society’s Problems

There are 2 critical problems facing our society today.  First the 401k system has failed. If you have made 60k / year and have had 2 kids, the odds of having $2.5 million off which to retire are very slim.  People need a mechanism to generate sustainable long term income. 

Second, “excess wages” have been eradicated from our economy.  If someone is working for just enough to pay for food, shelter and clothing, they aren’t buying snowmobiles, sailboats, second cars effectively cycling money through the economy.

##Providing Opportunity

We are all in this together.

There are infinitely more good people in this world that there are true opportunities.  I know as an executive, when you put an honest opportunity in front of a good person who needs a solution, magic happens.  

Direct agenda overlap.  We create an opportunity to help our clients do well in solving certain life needs.  The better our reps do at creating good productive relationships the better they do.  As an executive, the better I do at creating an environment where people on both the client side and affiliate side can prosper, the better I do. 

##Some Particulars

KCM’s door is open for people who are looking for an honest income solution.   With any endeavor, there are always “things” “they” don’t tell you which you always find out later. Here are our “things”:

 1. Yes, being a representative means “sales”.  Only in the sense that we invite good people into a solution that everyone already knows they need; just no one wants to talk about. We have sales tools which people genuinely are glad to see. From there, the process becomes a matter of defining their situation and providing a solution.
   
 1. There are upfront costs.  Certain professionals are exempt, but almost everyone will have to study for, and pass the Series 65 exam.  For most people who are employed with kids, this can take 6 – 8 weeks of study.  Depending on the study materials you choose and the exam cost you’ll be out $400 - $500.  Yes, that’s your cost.  In reality it’s our industry’s way of putting up just enough of a financial and time commitment barrier to entry ensuring there aren’t too many people in the business.  The people who are willing to commit some time and money are usually going to be serious enough to succeed.  

 1.	Income for reps is fee only. Reps receive 1099’s.  

	A simple example, if a rep develops 10 clients who each roll over a $90,000 401k into an IRA when they switch jobs, that would provide an ongoing monthly income of roughly $750 for the representative.  This is a simple example for the sake of discussion.  10, $90,000 roll over IRA’s is about $750 income per month recurring monthly as long as the client is a client. Your fee based income will vary with the amount of assets in your client’s accounts.   As client accounts change in value either up or down, so does the fee paid.

	Another example, if a rep develops 10 accounts at $45,000 the fee split to them would be approximately $375 per month.  
   
 1. There will be necessary ongoing costs.  We’ve got those down to Errors & Omission insurance and business cards and registration costs. If you stay with the minimal, it averages out to around $150 per month.  The rest like shirts, leave behinds or office costs are optional or are things you likely already spend on such as cellphone and computer.  Most of our docs are cloud based or PDF’s which you print.   Branded materials are available at your discretion through a predetermined outside vendor. Your expenses will largely depend on what you want to claim and how you conduct your affairs along the process. 

	Client interactions can be steered towards places of convenience for the client, usually their home, office or restaurant.  At some point you may want to open your own office for the sake of your convenience.

 1.	 Production, appointments, sales quotas:  There are certain annual costs we absorb for each representative. We are stressed until those are covered.  As an entity we are going to be a bit loving-pushy until a new rep gets up to a few hundred dollars per month in income.  After that point the rep has ‘got it’ and is peddling on their own.   The pushiness on our part resonates around getting the new reps to understand, trust and enjoy using the sales tools to the point where they chuckle ahead of time before they try to speak with someone.  Once that feeling of control and confidence sets in for the rep, we know they’ll get it and do fine.  Once the “I get it” clicks in, our role then becomes supportive.

 1. You don’t have to quit your existing job. You may want to make sure you have no conflicts. If you are intending to have income from other financial institutions, there may be conflicts which are prohibitive on our end.  We are a registered entity who is pre-emptively audited by regulatory agencies. We have to disclose and tell the truth. If you are here, this goes for you as well. You can have other income or a full time job from which you intend to retire eventually, but it must be fully disclosed. We are in the business of providing solutions and paths forward for people who want to walk them.  We realize that everyone has a different starting line.
 
 1. Our long term concern for reps.  Everyone gets to a certain point of autonomy; then they want to just enjoy life.  As a company we need to know what that is for you.  Some people want to develop large incomes. Others want a few thousand a month in income through their retirement so they can fish.
