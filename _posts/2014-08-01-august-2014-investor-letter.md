## Recent History

It’s been a busy month sorting out the new path forward.   

Coming out of June into July KCM investor accounts had begun to be positioned for the anticipation of market softness. The markets took a hit through the end of July followed by a low volume price rise to new highs on the commonly published indexes.

The late July sell off was driven by junk bonds selling off in a manner analogous to the canary in a coal mine falling asleep… quickly.

Even though indexes have looked good on TV, income producing products have dictated that we begin to position for possibilities other than full out accelerating markets.

## Ripple, Recover, What Else??

The S&P 500 exchange traded fund SPY illustrates the late July sell off and subsequent bounce.
This ripple was a “byproduct” for lack of better explanation of the High Yield Bond space starting to return to normal rates.

Higher interest rate debt started to lose support in July.  As rates return to normal, lots of other economic events will have to adjust in thought process and pricing.  Think of it as, can car loans get back to 10%?  Whether they do or not, the question is asked to generate empathy with the economic thought process in which we are all about to embark.  Rates go up, people act differently because they have to.

But this high yield selloff is not a brand new 1 time blip. Floating rate funds have been selling off for quite some time now.

REITs have also had a big correction before stabilizing.

Long ARR for certain KCM investors.  Not a recommendation. The chart looks boring, but after the selloff, it was giving investors a chance to buy in at 15% yields.

The more aggressive stocks have not participated in this year’s highly televised market rally to newest and bestest highs ever.  Micro Cap and Small Cap stocks have just been bouncing sideways.

But, the SP 500 keeps on levitating higher.

What’s worrying most managers right now:

For how long will the indexes which are touted on TV by our central planners remain levitating? Clearly most of the rest of the market is experiencing price action analogous to a collapsing cake in the oven, gently letting the air out.

## Slow Motion Rotation

Conceptually, this sets up a strategic plan which I can only describe as slow motion rotation.  There are assets in which one can invest because their correction has happened.  There are assets which have not yet completed their correction, so they can’t be owned.  There are assets which are starting their correction, they have to be sold.  There are assets which are still floating higher, those are to be held for now. 

And there’s a lot of time involved with each phase running its course.  

## On the Happy Side

King Dollar is back.  We’ve entered a phase where the Dollar is rising as we exit QE and return to normal interest rates.  This makes a lot of the stuff we buy cheaper.  Every day folks need this relief.

## Going Forward

The post QE world is upon us. We now have a shoppers market.

Rates will normalize. Large companies which got sucked higher in price simply because the Fed was juicing the markets are going to have to trade back to valuations which are established and supported by prudent investors.  

The game plan for going forward is really quite “old school” and refreshing:

Hold positions that are working
Sell those that stop working 
Patiently hold the cash waiting for good opportunities  

More specifically, for investor accounts, KCM is very aggressive certain stocks and the broad indexes.  But we are actively looking for more incredibly good entries within income producing positions.
