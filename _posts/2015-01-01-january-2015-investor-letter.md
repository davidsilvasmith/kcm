We have been navigating an unprecedented period in history.  Last month I discussed the process of High Frequency Trading platforms creating senseless volatility in the made for TV indexes to push humans back from taking positions. This activity has been coincidentally occurring against central bank index supportive intervention.  Central banks whether it be narcissism, incompetence, or graft have impaired their credibility with chronic rule changing.  Like children who throw the checkers board when they aren’t having the outcome they desire, a consortium of central banks has been undertaking regular efforts to undermine the economic realities of our reality.

For managed accounts, we’ve held high levels of cash.  Positions taken both long and short have frequently been closed in response to these central bank random acts of narcissistic foot stomping that have forced repetitive catalytic market repricing events.

##Central Banks vs High Frequency Trading (HFT)

This is a battle of two Darth Vaders.  Both have worked themselves into a corner with their manipulations.  Neither read Charles Dow, “All manipulations eventually end.” No sorrow should be had for either party as they simultaneously face their respective Waterloos.

Unfortunately, it’s a horridly crowded graphic. I’ve taken notes on a chart of SPY an ETF mimicking the S&P 500.  Over the past few months every time stocks on the whole have gone into a no-volume death spiral, some central bank makes an announcement of an action or threat of an action forcing short positions to cover.

Over the past 35 years, central banks have become increasingly addicted to their Keynesian omnipotence. At every recession since President Carter they’d lower rates or put money into the system to prop up asset prices to protect the wealth of the elite while the underclass starved through their economic cycle.  Now they are running very low on bullets; and omnipresent social media illuminates all truth instantly.  Hollow threat is the weapon de jour. 

Complicating things a tad, the masses have spoken.  JP Morgan, Bank of America and Citi all recently had abysmal earning reports.  We’re done playing the debt slave game.  It’s been a depression. Not a great recession. We are all now proud value consumers.  Gluttony is dead.  Low prices are going to have to cure low prices; we welcome deflation. 

HFT’s are designed to bleed every human participant dry.  Consequently there are very few humans participating in the markets and HFT’s must now prey upon each other.  Brokerage firms responding to their new “big dollar” automated clients have responded by whistling past the graveyard of naked short selling and excessive leverage. It was all about chasing revenue from zippy zillions of transactions…..  until….

##God Bless the Swiss!!!

January 15th premarket the Swiss National Bank who had previously announced negative interest rates unexpectedly announced -.75% interest rates and unpegged the Swiss Franc from the Euro.

Let me explain this happy catastrophe. 

The dotted line at the top is the exchange rate between the Swiss Franc and the Euro before the announcement.  Currency trading is very liquid. Hence brokers will provide excessive leverage. In many cases up to 100 to 1 because most stop losses are able to be executed in fractions of a penny.  As you can see, this announcement by the Swiss National Bank, caused HFT’s to take stops instantly at up to 45c losses when they are designed for fractions of a penny exits when things go wrong.

This gap down carnage was well earned and well deserved by those who engineered this hyper tech predatory system with which we are now saddled for a market.  Who needs humans to make rational decisions during inconvenient events when we have zippy computers??

##De-Marginization

The brokers who have been enabling the HFT/algo manipulators just got burned big time as they have to backstop the losses when a customer loses more than their account is worth.  These weren’t little losses.  Think of it as the first salvo of Karma for those who created the internet bubble.

What this really means?  Initially brokerage firms are scrambling to get their arms around counter party risk.  Who owes whom what and can they pay?  

Next the risk managers who have been rubber stamping this behavior are going to have to actually make tough choices.  Do we call in all excessive leverage at once?  Do we slowly taper our absurdly profitable naked short selling customers back?  

Here’s the problem the risk managers need to avoid repeating.  A bunch of their customers lost a lot of money.  Certainly someone was on the other side of those losing positions; those other customers won big.  But those that lost, suffered losses in excess of their account balances with the brokerages who provided the margin loans for the positions.  So the losers lost all of their money AND the broker’s money because the brokers were too loose with their lending.

How many times can the brokerage industry suffer these types of losses?  There’s never just one cockroach.  

Basically, risk managers will have to decide just how much money they are going to lend to computer programs which trade thousands of trades per second.  After the Swiss Franc losses, it’s reasonable to think their answer will be “we will lend less money”.  Less money in the system means the forced unwinding of large positions taken with borrowed money.

And after a long weekend of wound licking and choice pondering,…

First risk manager out wins. 

##Mega Growth Wave

To end with an inspirational thought.  1% in the world apparently control ½ the world’s wealth; according to The Guardian.

[http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/global-wealth-oxfam-inequality-davos-economic-summit-switzerland](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/global-wealth-oxfam-inequality-davos-economic-summit-switzerland)

This sets up our next mega growth wave. Equal to computers, the internet and the construction of the US highway system.  It’s not a new product or technology.  It’s a mindset shift.  Those who capture it are going to do exceedingly well.

People need income.  Excess income needs to flow into the working class.  Companies who shift their focus away from profiting from their customers off the efforts of their employees to finding ways to profitably make money for their employees are going to have very expansive businesses.

“Let me show you how you can make money joining into our business.” 

##Going Forward

There’s never just one cockroach.  The Swiss National Bank high leverage HFT blow up was the first, providing you look past Russia, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Belarus.  Now we’re on to China unexpectedly reducing margin lending tanking their markets.  We’ve been grappling with a percolation of mini blow ups being papered over by central banks for 6 months now. Things are just getting to the point where they can’t be hidden from the electorate any longer.  This central bank unwind is starting to accelerate a bit. While writing this, Denmark announced further rate cuts deeper into negative territory and Germany has announced it has resumed its gold repatriation efforts.

This week the European Central Bank is expected to vote on implementing another round of Quantitative Easing.  After Japan, US and China…. Maybe just maybe, if ***we*** throw good money after bad it will all be fixed??    Fixed? Likely not, but it will cause confusion and delay. 

Until the chaos from Central Banks settles, we are stuck in this unfortunate quandary of cant’s.  Getting aggressively short has proven dangerous as every time we’ve seen the markets progress along their down side path, the central banks have temporarily spiked the markets forcing shorts to cover.  Taking longs has proven unproductive as well because the markets have offered very little follow on buying prohibiting stocks to trend productively before retracement.

So we’ll keep expanding the list of great opportunities and move very cautiously until the markets begin to act favorably.
