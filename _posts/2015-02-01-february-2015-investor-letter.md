##Recent History

[20 rate cuts](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/20-central-banks-have-cut-rates-2015-after-surprise-rate-cut-israel-record-low-01) globally since the first of the year have propped the indexes. Assets which have been allowed to sell off have cratered; refer to your local gas pump. The income markets have been taking on a feel of selling softness over the past few weeks. The cabal of central banks have boxed themselves into an unpalatable position. 

For managed accounts it has been quest to find 'what's real?' maintaining respect for the migrating selloff which seems to be rolling through the markets one asset group at a time.

##Macro Event Punch List

Europe / Greece – Off the front burner for today.  Greece is still Germany’s slave state.  Lots of theatre over the past 2 months, no Greek exit from the EU, no default… yet. But it’s the weekend.  Come mid-week the situation could rattle apart yet again with Greece leaving the European Union.

Oil - Oil rig counts are still dropping.  Existing production is not yet waning.  Supplies are rising. The question being, “Does production wane before storage fills or does production shut in once storage is filled?” Regardless, production is likely going to taper at some point in time bringing an undersupplied market. 

Russian led banking system - Russia ratifies BRIC’s version of IMF.  Soon there will be a mechanism to offer indebted nations such as Greece a set of choices as to whom they are indentured.  Bad for the western banking Arrogancia who have enjoyed control for centuries.

Ukraine - They are preparing for full war with Russia.  They are asking for western lethal weapons.  I guess we’ll get to test the adage that “All wars are banking wars.”

Islamic State of Iraq and Syria / Middle East – President Obama authorized Syrian Rebels to call in B1 air support against Syria’s government forces. 

The major macro catalyst events seem to be on hold for now.

##Natural Gas

To paraphrase the most recent EIA weekly report, natural gas supplies are somewhat historically normal. Existing production is currently adequate to hold supplies at a historically normal level but rig count has been reducing with further reductions anticipated.

Natural gas has gotten hit with oil.

If natural gas supply is in line with historical norms, ongoing rig count reductions means reduced supply in the future. Pricing should face upward pressure until we see production expansion resume.

For managed accounts we have natural gas long exposure through exchange traded funds. Not a recommendation.

##Truth in Pits and Pools

Over the past couple months I've found myself in an enlightening web of conversations. The first was with a longtime friend. He asked me out of the blue why he was seeing excavators catch up on large receivables due to his gravel pits. It didn't reconcile with any of his other endeavor's projections which track closer to Bloomberg's macro indicator both showing the economy getting worse as we head into the long awaited unwind.

A friend at Bank of America echoed to me CEO Moynihan's sentiments of you can only lend as much as your customers want. BAC's top line was off close to 10% last quarter.

First Merit branch workers say the same to me; very little demand for debt.
Brighton Custom Pool and Spa is booked for a while. Brighton Custom Pool and Spa is a gunite swimming pool contractor with reach across Michigan. They do meticulous pools of all sizes. CEO Steve Essayan shared many thoughts with me this weekend. First, they use 100 tons of sand on their average project. Second, people aren’t using debt to do these pools. 

For Steve’s customers, it’s a lifestyle spend detached from the realities of the economy.  Sure a lot of it is trophy spend, but at the root level they’ve earned, saved, survived and they just want good honest quality workmanship for their spend. They’ll wait in line knowing they have the reputable pool builder doing their pool.

Jim Coyle at Leelanau Log Homes ½ hour north of Traverse City is seeing the same thing.  They are backed up too.  The buyers are cashed up survivors paying their draws out of their personal checking accounts. The people are relaxed and just want a high level of quality.

Careful what you wish for. This is what the policy makers wanted. People are learning the joy of not being indebted. 
There is solid economic growth at the lower rungs as people have had to become financially responsible.  It doesn’t seem like enough growth to support the indexes which are being pushed by negative interest rates. This leaves a huge first step down for the global corporatocracy.

People aren’t preoccupied with appearing rich beyond their means. Gluttony for gluttony’s sake is dead. Now it’s about quality of lifestyle and stress reduction.  

For investors, with 20 interest rate cuts globally this year to prop up the global equities markets, bringing multiple central banks to charge negative interest for deposits, the question is what’s real? 

People are focused on buying quality purchases they can afford while the central banks dig themselves deeper into hole to prop up equities.  Assets which have sold off, sold off for a very long time before they found footing. How palatable is it to chase the well-known TV indexes like 1999 when former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is muttering terms like violent unwinding.

So once again, what has sold off that will be bought by those who have money to spend on quality of life purchases?  Aggregates, life sustaining energy, food? 

You can find stories of coal mines being bought for pennies on the dollar, while Snapchat which allows 12 yr. old girls to share selfies gets shopped for $19 billion. Tangent: Sprint is now charging you monthly to purchase your $800 cell phone instead of giving you the phone for staying in a contract.  We’ll see how many replacement cycles selfie on a stick narcissism lasts. My kids are going to have a hard time replacing their broken iPhones on their incomes.
For managed accounts we are looking at life quality oriented basics.  What’s needed no matter what?

##Tin Foil Hat Time

At the risk of seeming like a complete left turn away from this newsletter’s theme, come try on a tin foil hat with me.

Last month, I mentioned the algorithm blow out of the Swiss Franc.  Here’s a follow on chart to give a refresher.  That big green spike in price happened across a handful of trades.

Next is the Canadian Dollar.  Near the beginning of the graph, you’ll see a long red line stepping price down in just a few trades as well.

The algorithm hedge funds are now large enough to throw currencies around like rag dolls. People who control jails, armies, currencies and covert agencies aren’t going to like that.  Google “Banker Suicides”.

For our investors, this all circles back to the idea that there are some unfathomable yet to be explained events occurring. What’s real?  What’s immune to events of the un-real?

##Going Forward

For the first time in close to a year and a half, I’m getting excited about the investment climate.  Yes, I’m the same guy who just wrote the prior 5 pages.  And I did re-read it multiple times. In spite of the existing chaos and chaos yet to come, I’m getting excited.  We can finally define the environment in which we are operating. It’s been quite a while since we could make that statement. 

There has been a slow motion sell off starting with iron ore, moving to copper, micro-cap, oil & gas.  The bond market and widely held indexes are still being propped by central banks moving to negative interest rates.  But, that will run into the ceiling of absurdity at some time. 

For the foreseeable future, sober value investing is the theme.  Fancy stuff is out.
