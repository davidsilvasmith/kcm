##Recent History
Over the past year we’ve been playing insanely tight defense.  But the focus is starting to change.  Now that the main market has finally let go a little bit we’ve been able to start putting money back to work in carnage plays for our clients.  Not a lot of money, but a little; an opportunistic first nibble which we don’t think we’ll have to unwind.

##The Millennium Apex
In the past, it took me a few efforts to get to the final answer on my prognostication regarding the US intentions in the Middle East and Oil.  The end goal was to sew chaos eventually pitting Shia vs Sunni so they’ll destroy their own oil fields.  The agenda item it seems to me is a part of an even larger agenda which started back 15 years or so.

At some point in modern history, the US came to the realization Social Security (Long Life Expectancy), Interest on Debt, Military Spending and Purchase of Foreign Oil were the items that would bankrupt the US.  Notice how our policy makers never identified Medicaid or other voter’s social benefits as a problem.   Take that cadre of items, mix in some globalization, cross-culturalization and omnipresent truthiness and we find ourselves standing at the starting tip of our next period in history.  The post globalization Millennium Apex.

Let’s check off some boxes.  Obama Care is a euthanasia plan killing people passively on the margin.  With our Obama care policy, my 9 yr. old’s Dr. visit copays were $95.  My wife’s 2nd mammogram was 100% not covered.  If you can’t afford to use the system,… This was by design.  If we reduce life expectancy a little at a time, eventually Social Security and Medicare become less burdensome.

Foreign wars?  We just gave policing of the Middle East over to Russia and China.

Interest on Debt?  If the Fed pays 0 -3% forever?

Outflows for foreign oil?  That’s a little more complex.  During the 14 years of post-Afghanistan invasion, the US built out its domestic oil.  Brazil built out theirs, with the US’s help.  China is now launching EV, EV battery exchange and ICE/EV carbon exchange type credits.  The US has in place the infrastructure to shift to LNG / CNG / RNG for trucking.  Westport’s ISL G [was just approved by California’s Air Resource Board](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/isl-g-near-zero-natural-200500346.html) and the EPA as being Near 0 emissions.  (Long WPRT, not a recommendation).  Can you say ARB subsidy??

The EV drive system manufacturer in position to benefit from CARB subsidies is UQM. No Position, Not a Recommendation. 

Now that the dominoes are in place…..     tip….   tip…  tip.. tip. tip tip ttip tttip ttttp…..


##Two People Can’t Keep a Secret
If one person tells another person something, there’s no way the secret is being kept.  How in the world can VW run an emissions altering program for years without regulators knowing about it? Someone had to design the script.  Someone else had to load the software.  Someone else had to test the software. And we are supposed to believe all those people and their mangers all stayed happily employed and silent?   And regulators all said, “Wow!!!! You’re getting 43mpg and super clean!!!”  

I’m throwing the BS card.  Now you are seeing articles starting to pop up about other autos with emissions issues.

IMHO bureaucrats stretched the limits of engineering with their clean air mandates for ICE.  Auto makers collectively had no choice to push back and say these targets are unreasonable.  For the sake of making bad regulation work regulators settled for auto manufacturers putting forth an effort to appear as though they were in compliance.  Now that replacement tech is in place, this action against VW looks like the first domino.  This is resonating as a policy generated hit on eco-friendly diesel to clear the playing field for the next stage of the shift from oil.

Greenies are being shamed.  Eco friendly diesel was a badge of honor for which they paid extra and used condescendingly in conversation delivering gentle self-righteous social lectures one friend at a time. Now they walk into a room of buddies to hear, “Hi Smokey!”  To save face they have to source other responsible technologies???  But what??

##ISIS Sunni Shia ShaBOOOM
We are supposed to believe the 2014 oil futures Thanksgiving Day bear raid was either happenstance or the Saudi’s waging a war on the US oil industry.  It was deliberate alright.  And by market theory, the raid from $75 to $40 was possible, so of course it happened.    What if it wasn’t the Saudis?

Dating back to Nixon, the US had an arrangement to protect the House of Saud for oil being denominated in US Dollars.  Clearly the US has shifted towards stirring chaos and integrating Iran.  Now the Middle East is cash stressed, the US is backing away.  Iran is sabre rattling boots on the ground in Syria.  Saudi Arabia is sabre rattling beyond its action in Yemen.

If Shia and Sunni are finally allowed to slug it out, does anyone really think someone isn’t going to target the other’s oil infrastructure?

##Time To Close The Loop
It appears, the whole Iraq war was to buy us time while the US developed domestic oil production, and develop alternatives like LNG/CNG for trucking here and EV in China.

Rig count is down.  Conversations with oil men say drilling is shut in.  We’re behind the depletion curve. Production is coming down.  Drilling isn’t happening at $45.  $45 is $45 even if its $45 due to HFT We aren’t yet drilling because futures are artificially held lower by HFT’s.

This is playing out like theater.  Mark down oil, hold it down closing supply.  Mix up the Middle East with militants creating chaos until the region goes painfully out of control.  When oil finally spikes due to lack of supply, drillers unable to find funding and long lead times to bring production back on line once prices do start moving, then push the waiting convenient solution of green energy.   

Consumers won’t adopt LNG or EV without a crisis that makes the new tech easier to adopt rather than staying with legacy technologies. In the States Nat Gas is around 2.45?  Oil starting to ramp and drilling is well behind the depletion curve.  Mix in some California ARB subsidies and some federal subsidies and the switch to LNG for trucking becomes a quick adoption.


##SEC Shout Out

At the end of September I published a white paper outlining some very dyer HFT trading activity within the market which has gone unchecked for a while.  Effectively some firm or group of firms were running algorithms which deliberately trade through the bids when bids get thin.  This manipulation is systemically worrisome as it artificially priced stocks well below their fundamental valuations driving human investors to make rational decisions with their investment capital elsewhere and forcing issuers to reevaluate their desire to keep their listings on exchanges.

Even though I published the [white paper Issuer Epiphany at HVST.com,](https://www.hvst.com/posts/51670-issuer-epiphany) the optimal venue for bringing market thoughts into the realm of ideas, it would be absurd for me to say, “Some mega fund was shut off due to my little ol’ paper.” Although they would deserve it after all the knowingly misrepresentative hit pieces designed to thin the bids so algos could sell through, counterfeiting of stock, and bogus complaints brought to regulators attempting to get companies delisted and honest investors bogged down in regulatory actions resulting ultimately in no action letters.  Some of the activity pieces together to appear as collusion in deliberately misrepresenting facts to cause financial harm.  Truthiness trumps all now, the evidence trail is immortalized on servers.  Look at poor Hillary Clinton.  She can’t keep any skeleton in a closet now. Elliott Ness is smiling in his grave about this era in history.

That being said, in the last three days of trading, the automated hit through the bid algorithm which has been decimating the price of non-institutional stocks has been off. I’ve been watching in joy. 

Allowing certain market participants the ability to use high speed computers to deliberately hit though thin bids solely for the purpose of marking down stock prices and further scaring humans out of their investments creating vicious cycles of wealth destruction has been the biggest travesty the markets have seen.

In reality it looks like the SEC may have trapesed across the activity through examination or complaint and has ordered the activity halted.  If so, this is very important for the markets.  It allows companies to once again sustain a natural market assessed valuation.

The heavily shorted stocks we follow, still have short sellers fighting to defend their mega size short positions, but now the only tool they seem to have is 10,000 share blocking offers. 

Making positions in new relatively illiquid, undervalued stocks has felt like old school this week.  We can’t get hit.  And when take the offer, we aren’t being immediately pushed back down.

Nice job guys.  

##Going Forward
For managed accounts, KCM has been long oil, EV and LNG / CNG.    We have been gingerly deploying cash into other scorned, hated, abandoned, deep value, sectors which have been unfairly decimated by predatory algorithms because they weren’t part of the pop culture mega stock ramp of the past 4 years; shippers, commodities, countries.

In looking through the premarket spreads.  It’s a happy happy world for the good guys.  Whoever was running this massive layered time frame scheme is having some well-earned sleepless nights.  Within the companies that have survived, there are massive 20,30, 40% short positions.  This activity has been destructive to the global capital system. They’ve cost jobs, ruined families, ruined businesses and industries.  All because they’ve been able to write software which allows them to decimate traded securities. 

For our clients we intend to continue digging through the unwind of their manipulation looking for value.

All inquiries are welcome.
