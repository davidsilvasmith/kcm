##Recent History

Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.  Central banks and their governments are pushing into the territory of even crazier.

[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-28/federal-government-set-to-introduce-tax-on-bank-deposits/6355662](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-28/federal-government-set-to-introduce-tax-on-bank-deposits/6355662)

Australia now wants to tax bank deposits. Negative interest rates and other creative ways to force people into supporting the markets is the theme.  

At some point this froth reconciles with reality.  For KCM Investors, we are attempting to stay away from the un-natural craziness and focus on finding places to invest which are rooted in solid principles of value and growth.

##Control Shift- Truthiness Trumps All

There are three levels of geopolitical 

*  Onsite legacy political structures man-handle the masses, create rules, hold elections, run jails and executions.  They are the culturally relevant hands on carrot and stick.
* The Corporatocracy is the next level higher about which many complain.  It’s our global power brokers who individually talk policy and subsequently influence policy through the steering of agenda items through local political systems.
* Now overbridging both the political structures and the corporatocracy is the omni-present dissemination of the truth by instant mass media.  The truthiest truth now rules.

We are seeing the shift from the old way of doing biz to the new way.  It used to be that one would ascend to power doing whatever they want, providing they maintained their benevolent façade and their control.  Now the truth never goes away.  We are seeing removal and prosecutions of bad cops, touchy teachers, bumbling bureaucrats, predatory politicians, and mischievous market chieftains are now scrambling to sort out their own future existence for they know the future really is about providing value to the customer.

The masses individual ability to source and agree upon truths using thumbs up thumbs down pass fail good / bad labeling is changing the world for the better.  Currently we are in the early stages of purging people who have acted nefariously as their truths come out. 

The next round of leaders are very conscious about their histories.  If you say “Vote for me!! I’m honest and true and will fight for you!”, you kind of have to mean it now.  Because your history will be judged by the masses fully and fairly. 

If you say we want our listing companies and end investors to prosper, you kind of have to mean it because people now are empowered to shun shenanigans with the touch of their thumb. “Rigged” stuck instantly for a reason. The behaviors permitted by the SEC have people shunning the markets.  New small listings and new investors are just seldom seen.

Blaming the SEC, Mark Cuban [opines about the inability to do deals under $25 million dollars](http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20150311-1.ece), while his [Sharesleuth.com](http://www.sharesleuth.com/) site runs multiyear campaigns against developing companies such as Kandi Technologies who then have to [refute short seller claims through subsequently intensive SEC scrutiny.](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/kandi-technologies-announces-conclusion-sec-140200854.html)  

Cuban is right, or at least 1/2 right. This is the SEC’s fault. The SEC allowing people to run chronic spin campaigns designed to harm listing companies and their investors is an enormous reason people quit doing small deals.  Who in their right mind wants to subject their life work to the feeding frenzy of spin?  

I don’t think these people understand how illuminated they are. Another activist manager Bill Ackman gets chuckles when he suggest people sell their Herbal Life (no position, not a recommendation) stock which he’s been short and trying to destroy it for years.  After raising chuckles in a realm of gentility, he has the gall to suggest  “…he knows the SEC has limited resources to investigate wrongdoing and that the agency should have a "quarterly sit-downs" with the market's top short sellers to help detect fraud.”

Maybe the masses are now empowered to ferret out truths beyond the spin?

KCM is still long KNDI, not a recommendation. [Institutional holders are beginning to follow us in](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/kndi/institutional-holdings) as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, CALPERS and many others have begun nibbling into KNDI in spite of Marc Cuban’s Sharesleuth.com perennial anti-KNDI campaign alleging all sorts of not good things regarding the company and its shareholders.

This is just one of the KNDI factories.  If your screen allows, pinch and expand the picture.  You’ll see, the sea of white stretching the width of the photo are micro-bus or car share cars.

People can produce spin ad nauseam, but we live in a world where nearly everyone has an internet camera in their pocket.

No matter how much money heavy weights like Ackman and heavy weight protégés like Cuban throw at destructive spin with the intent to harm a company’s listing, the truth is now omni-present. Up until this period in history, efforts such as that employed through Sharesleuth would have been effective at destroying Kandi.  But today, everyone can simply start digging for information on their cellphones to find the truth.  

Just like politics and bureaucracies, Wall Street’s duplicitous disingenuous behavior is in the early stages of self-purging.  How the regulators navigate their interpersonal come to Jesus talk with the onset of their own era of regulatory public accountability and how the industry chieftains come to embrace the fact that they need to provide value to end investors has yet to play out.  The truth isn’t going away.

For generations, regulators have buried their heads claiming they don’t have resources to pursue the expansive cases.   Michael Lewis’ book Flash Boys leads us to believe that “Resources” apparently means – The compelling backlash someone feels once truth has been uploaded to the internet for the masses to see.  

##Oil Shock Lurking? 

The napkin sketch of variables:
Low prices cure low prices.
Rig count has been coming in for quite some time now. 
At some point production follows rig count.
ISIS has already ignited oil fields in Takrit.
Spring refinery maintenance season ending soon.
Summer driving season begins soon.
Internet news sites illustrate US arms are making their way to ISIS in a fashion such that one must wonder if the US is intentionally arming all sides of the middle east conflicts.
The West has been segregating Shia and Sunni for decades. Now the West appears to be proving arms and fostering unbridled conflict.
News from the Middle East is increasingly discussing conflicts in conjunction with oil route choke points.

We are headed into the summer driving season with drilling waning while the Middle East conflicts are waxing.  With the West stepping back, the logical conclusion for the conflict is finding that balance of regional control between Shia and Sunni.  

Maybe they’ll find peace through non-violent negotiation?  Or maybe they’ll slug it out without touching each other’s oil infrastructure?

##Barron Absorbed

We’ve come to expect being able to spend a few minutes on our smart phone to source the absolute truth on any issue in minutes.  We’ve come to expect to disseminate and adopt truths instantaneously.

This is working its way through all aspects of our global culture.  All that we do is being re-done.  We’re forcing out the extraneous and the miscreants and sourcing what’s right and best.

With news media, Drudgereport led.  Now ZeroHedge.com carries the torch if you want to find the truth.  They’ve done no advertising. People found what they were saying valuable. Those sites have become the news institution.  Media is now controlled by the consumer instead of a cabal of infrastructure power brokers.  

Truth and goodness rise to the top instantly in this new paradigm. Media titans of this next era only need a message which connects souls with souls. 

I’m excited for a friend who is embarking on a journey with his show.  It’s official, Tim Barron has been absorbed by the Soul to Soul Media Movement; shedding the corporatocracy’s building and a tower like a really big and aged butterfly shedding its cocoon. 

Tim Barron is launching [http://www.timbarronsradiomichigan.com/](http://www.timbarronsradiomichigan.com/)  

Tim will tell you with a few exceptions, he’s always been able to do the fun, informative, live local compassionate shows which he’s wanted to do.   As a listener, I’ll add the caveat those shows were within constraints of local demographics. 
This format will allow Tim to fully explore conversations and topics on which he’s noticeably held back because he’s afraid of drifting too far from his small market Middle-American demographic.  No longer constrained by a 30 mile broadcast signal, Tim will be able to fully expand on all things which truly interest him drawing from clusters of listeners geographically dispersed but concentrated more intensely in similar interests.

For those of you within the region, Michigan, Indiana and Chicagoland w/ Michigan proclivities, bookmark the site and give the show some of your time as it comes on line. Knowing Tim it will be a fun, intellectually honest show blending some high culture and some not so high culture with all things everyday living in our region. I expect this to quickly become the regional go to radio show for all things fun and important in Michigan. Or just a wonderful thing to protest when your group is out of things or people at which to be angry. 

I’m also putting it out there now.  Even though he’s launching with his morning show, it’s an easy leap to add good content once the infrastructure is in place.

Barron going online only is another welcomed step towards a world where people are able to source truth and goodness unfettered. 

##Investor Sobriety

In simplest language, the high frequency / algorithm trading platforms have won control of the large indexes along with commodities and are asserting their grip on currencies.

The first phase of their control is a shakeout phase where they rattle prices around violently causing humans to step away from the uncertainty.  

This first chart is a daily chart of the SPY an ETF mimicking the SP 500.  Take notice of the smooth trading still visible from November.  Notice how choppy the daily trading ranges become through Dec-Jan. This is resuming once again.  

![SPY Daily](/images/posts/2015-04-01-april-2015-investor-letter/clip_image004.1.3.jpg "SPY Daily")

Next is the SPY on an hourly time frame showing how it traded during the day.  The blue lines on the right illustrate where the market is currently priced after hours. If trading for the day were to start now, this is the place the orange lines would resume.  If it looks like computers are setting prices rather arbitrarily in order to undermine human manager’s investing choices, well…..

![SPY Hourly](/images/posts/2015-04-01-april-2015-investor-letter/clip_image004.1.4.jpg "SPY Hourly")

The end purpose of these exercises in other smaller capitalizations has been to confuse and reduce human interaction in the markets.  When humans step back then the algorithms face less resistance in moving prices to desired targets.  The process ends with down side price probing to find levels where the remaining humans absorb all selling.  

Effectively, deep value fundamental analysis becomes unfathomably deeper value fundamental analysis.

Harkening back to “Resources”.  The presence of this manipulative activity is not a secret.  What’s different now; the world is hanging the existence of this manipulation around the neck of the SEC who has cried “Lack of Resources” hiding behind cloaks of secrecy as they investigate and fine with little net change. The solution is easy. If it looks like manipulation, review the trade records and halt all activity of the firm placing the trades until the SEC has a chance to fully investigate.  Once 2 or 3 firms are halted for investigation, no one else will even want to participate in acts which have the possibility of appearing suspicious. In the real world, guilty until proven innocent does not mean a cop allows what looks like a burglary in progress to continue until trial.   No the cop says, “Hey come over here, what are you doing?”

##Going Forward

There are certain things we are looking for in this realm of algo dominance.  

First, avoid anything which is bloated with hopeful humans.  

We are looking for positons which have already been decimated by crushing algorithm selling. There needs to be a feel of, sell as much as you want, the remaining buyers are absorbing all sellers. 

There also needs to be compelling reasons to believe the company will be significantly larger in the future so the equity will price up in the face of algorithm selling pressure.  

i.e. CLNE provides LNG/CNG fuel for approximately 40,814 trucks from [p4 of their recent 10k](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FileName=0001047469-15-001290.txt&FilePath=%5C2015%5C02%5C26%5C&CoName=CLEAN%20ENERGY%20FUELS%20CORP.&FormType=10-K&RcvdDate=2/26/2015&pdf=).  Today they announced another 115 from Raven Transport an existing customer. This addition will allow for the opening of many CLNE / Flying J stations in the South East.  [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/raven-transport-deploy-115-additional-100100692.html](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/raven-transport-deploy-115-additional-100100692.html)  There are 15 million semi-trucks on the road.  We will likely own this in some magnitude until we sense market saturation.  But it’s going to be a volatile hold. It still has a [23% short interest according to Finance.Yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=clne&ql=1). Not a recommendation.

As for the parts of the market investors have been conditioned to love over the past 30 years of Federal Reserve interest rate reductions such as bonds and highly liquid equities, we are going to do whatever we can to walk gingerly through these areas only when we must.  There is a lot of work which needs to be done in mass awareness equities and fixed income as rates normalize and algos wring out all speculative froth.  

Funds which hold assets that are difficult for algorithms to trade are looking attractive until we see how all this plays out.
