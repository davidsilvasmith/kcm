By Todd Krajniak

During 2012, I wrote a couple lightweight pieces on Kandi Technologies in anticipation of the day when Krajniak Capital moves from incubation to reaching out. I wanted the evidence trail in cyberspace to timestamp our presence in the position.

KNDI’s path has morphed over time in response to political winds in China, but the end game is still intact. The path has been tortured with an epic short seller battle.  So many people are searching for the smoking gun.

The day of shifting towards KCM reaching out is here. As we resume publishing to give incoming investors the ability to get their arms around KCM’s thought process, it’s just right to close the loop by providing the answer all Kandi shareholders and short sellers want or don’t want answered………

What are “THEY” hiding?

 
##Why we were in the KNDI position originally?

China needed a smog reducing solution for its new found love of the automobile.

Kandi’s Quick Battery Exchange offered to bring a sensible solution to the shortcomings of EV. 

To me, I saw the 2 seater EV being sold without the battery similar to the original cellphones or printers; a disposable product which quickly and cheaply established dependence on a new technology. Instead of it being cell phone minutes or toner replacements, it was the battery exchange. 

##Why we are in the position now?

China still has smog and the politics pushing the shift to EV are cementing.

Depending on the region, Kandi’s cars can cost less than the announced subsidies.

Kandi’s Quick Battery Exchange Patents have Kandi well positioned to own the patents of the industry standard EV fuel pump.

We discovered KNDI for our investors over 2 years ago in the $3 price range, big name institutions are just now discovering KNDI.

## What I got wrong in my initial analysis of KNDI?

I did not understand the Chinese culture.

In the west, anyone with $1 is king of the minute. The world stops for that person until they pay for their hamburger.  China is a patriarchal top down culture where giving people or entities ranking higher in the protocol pyramid their respect and ability to maintain ‘Face’ is more important than results.

China’s patriarchal culture has slowed down the EV implementation significantly. Once the obvious was obvious which was Kandi had developed and tested a viable EV solution in Jinhua, before it could be rolled out, it had to be adopted and negotiated at every subsequent level up to Beijing.  Then EV programs had to be announced as being implemented all the way back down from Beijing through Hangzhou and Jinhua. This process seemed to have to be repeated with subsidy adoption, approval and now implementation.

##What about the epic short seller drama?

Kandi has suffered one of the most public and drama filled short battles I will see in my life time. Most of the hit pieces are available at Seeking Alpha, along with many bullish articles. Through the comment sections following the articles one can get a feel for all of the drama.

To get a grip on the story line of how a 300,000 share short position turned into a 6,300,000 share short position and what it means going forward it’s best to look though the chart by periods of history and offer a little commentary to illustrate the evolution.

September 21, 2012, Art Porcari sourced a [PRC policy paper](http://seekingalpha.com/article/893481-prc-policy-paper-favors-kandi-technologies-ev-program-for-all-of-china) which stated that the Chinese government would act to support a few EV initiatives, one being the Kandi EV programs. This came a couple months after the city of Hangzhou’s letter of intent to support Kandi’s 20,000 EV leasing program.

As you can see by the following chart, 3 days later Geoinvesting published their first major hit piece against Kandi, complete with tales of innuendo and photos of Chairman Hu Xiaoming’s house as provided by their in investigator on the ground in China. This crashed the stock to $3.08 before recovering much of the losses by the end of the session.

Through the remainder of 2012 and into 2013, there were a multitude of follow on negative articles from Geo and Sharesleuth.  The real news out of China covered the announcement of a new factory in Huzhou, and the upcoming JV with Geely.  It was a very promising news trail that was being assaulted by short sellers.  During this period the shares shorted increased to 700,000 shares.

Most of the squiggly lines on the chart are moving averages. I keep them there for reference as many computer trading programs will buy and sell along those lines in a pre-programmed fashion.  As you can see by the selloffs in the above chart, buyers were waiting along the longer term moving averages. 

But, on June 5, the nightmare began.

![](/images/posts/2014-06-15-kandi-technologies-group-kndi-what-they-are-hiding/K2.png)

Well, it’s been a nightmare for the fund who had been shorting the stock. 

Going into June 5, the stock traded roughly 70,000 shares per day, had a 700,000 share short interest, and roughly 19 million shares floating.  Much of that float was believed to be held by savvy individual investors who are self-made.  I met many in Atlanta at the investor conference.  Due to the high conviction of this base of successful individual shareholders, I believe the float available for trading was significantly smaller than 19 million shares.  On June 5, the stock traded 18 million shares in volume.  It took 60 million shares in volume to contain the momentum run.  With a fraction of 19 million available for trading, from where did all of that volume come?

If 1% of the 19,000,000 share float traded in a day, that’s only 190,000. It’s my contention that the shares of the float available for trading were significantly lower than 19,000,000.  This barrage of volume was well beyond a statistical anomaly.

By the middle of July KNDI was on the Reg SHO Threshold list. This means someone counterfeited a significant amount of stock in order to drive the price down. 

Jerry Klein, a man with a well-earned impressive resume, files the first shareholder [complaint to the SEC](http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/11442671-gdubw/2027242-how-kndi-shareholders-actually-got-punked) regarding the counterfeiting at the August 2013 lows. 

Into early November, the short sellers had counterfeited enough stock to drive it onto the Reg SHO Threshold list again.  Kandi in its 2013 annual report disclosed receiving a subpoena from the SEC around Thanksgiving.  

There is still some residual ballyhoo about the unknown nature of the inquiry, but we do know the stock came off the Reg SHO Threshold list and the stock price tripled shortly following the receipt of the SEC subpoena.

After the annual report, on March 14, the short fund preyed on the fears of investors by leveraging the 10k SEC Subpoena disclosure.  They tried breaking the stock yet again driving the short interest up to 6,000,000 shares approximately 23% of the float. The price has been pushed down into the moving average band which I illustrate on this chart template. 

![]( /images/posts/2014-06-15-kandi-technologies-group-kndi-what-they-are-hiding/k4.png)

The moving averages bring automated trading both long and short.  By pressing the stock down into those bands this brings a new class of short sellers providing selling into which the longer term manipulative short sellers are able to find supply. 

It’s my opinion that the fund which has been working this large short position is trying to cover by holding the price within the moving average bands for the purpose of covering into the automated short selling algorithms. Since the release of the 10k, the number of open out of the money call contracts has increased to be large enough to cover the total short position.

##What “THEY” are hiding?

The volume since June 5, 2013 has been uh…. ahem.. statistically questionable. Even after all the secondaries and warrants, 1% of the float changing hands in a day would be 260,000 shares.  2% around 500,000 shares per day.  We are now settling in to just under 4% of the float trading per day.

With all the volume, two tours on the Reg SHO Threshold list, blowing out the short percentage to nearly 24%, and all the hit pieces, why does the stock still print higher lows?

The character of shareholder in this company is different than any I’ve ever seen.  The long term holders aren’t finance guys.  They skew heavily toward self-made business men. The folks I met at the investor / anaylst conference were people who have made their fortunes having a vision and bringing that vision to reality, inspite of mass disbelief in their visions, or having to fend off nuisance law suits or having to maintain composure while being slandered.  They, and including myself, thus ‘we’, empathize with Chairman Hu’s plight.  We see the vision through the China smog too.

As the company is extremely conservative about its p/r, the shareholders have had to do their research through translating Chinese media and pooling their efforts through a private yahoo chat group.  This group has meticulously sourced and posted hundreds of articles, photos and feedback from multiple investor trips to visit the company. 

This mix of entrepreneurial empathy, hard sought information, and needing to dig for information 10 times harder than normal to refute the barrage of short pieces attempting to break the bid so HFT’s could run rough shot through the chart has created an insanely strong shareholder culture in Kandi.

The problem the shorts have is not the 6,300,000 shares short which has likely expanded yet again this week.  Their conundrum is much more complex. They’ve taken a stock which has roughly 25.5 million shares floating.  The actual amount of those share held by people who say “over my dead body will they come out of my cash account” leaves the percentage of float available for trading to likely be significantly smaller than 25.5 million.

With the short interest added to the float, there are roughly 32 million shares available for ownership.  What if, due to the commitment it has taken to get ones arms around KNDI the number of shares held in the hands of people who say “over my dead body will they come out of my cash account” is actually greater than say 29 million shares, while institutions are just now beginning to add the stock?  29 million was picked out of thin air for the sake of the example.

Conceptually, the number of shares of float actually willing to trade is an integer just like interest rates apparently are according to the ECB. 

If you take the 25.5 million shares and place them all in the hands of people who put them in a cash account for their great grandchildren, the number of shares available for trading is 0.   If 22.5 million of them are in a cash account held for their grandchildren, then the shares available for trading are 3 million.   Now what happens if say someone borrows those 3 million shares and through shorting and rehypothication sells 6.3 million shares short?  For the sake of this example suppose 4 million of those shorted 6.3 million get bot by people who tuck them away into a cash account for their grandchildren?   Negative availability.

It’s unusual, but possible that a short fund could hypothecate and rehypothecate themselves into a position where the amount of shares owned by longs holding long term is greater than the float; hence shares of the float available for trading is a negative number thus an integer.

If you think that’s a statistical stretch, let’s discuss the volume in Kandi. The shorts got buggered on June 5, 2013.  It took 60+ million shares in volume across 2 weeks to squelch a short squeeze of 700,000 shares in a stock which did 70,000 shares a day in volume. 

Repeat…  700,000 shares short ….  Took 60 million shares of volume to defend.

Why did volume never return to its long term resting volume?  The float hasn’t increased that dramatically.  The company’s visibility hasn’t increased that dramatically.  The media driven prejudice hasn’t subsided.

If one wants to do something interesting, pull up 1min charts for the past 2 months.  You’ll find periods where the algorithms are stopped.  The stock is mausoleum quiet when the algos aren’t running.  That’s what they are hiding.  Someone has put out 6 million shares in a stock which is illiquid without algos running. 

Since the stock isn’t ramping and short interest is still growing, wanna take a guess at who owns those algorithms inflating volume?

##Uh, now what boss???

Trading over the past couple weeks feels as though the short interest has increased again, maybe to 6.6 million shares.  It’s just a feel. 

Daily volume over the past two weeks has fallen to under 1 million shares. This should put the published number around 7 days to cover.

In calculating days to cover, if one adjusts the float to shares of float willing to trade, the days to cover by implication of fewer shares being available to trade would seem to need to be adjusted higher.  Take away the statistically questionable trading volume which has kept average daily volume elevated…  let the stock trade without the enhancement of the algos and the days to cover goes crazy high.

Yes, it is my opinion that someone is running an algorithm base trading scheme for the sole purpose of inflating volume for the purpose of masking the real average daily volume and a days to cover number which accurately reflects the dire situation. Keep in mind, volume went nuts on the breakout where someone sold the stock onto the Reg SHO Threshold list, and volume has not yet come back to a percent of float traded daily level which we see throughout the market.

##Getting to a guestimate on the “Crazy High” days to cover number?

Cross multiply the ‘way back’ 70,000 shares a day volume on 19 million shares floating with today’s 25.5 million share float.  Average daily volume proportionately would be roughly 94,000 shares.

Covering 6.3 million shares on 94,000 shares per day would take 67 days.  Now that’s a crazy high days to cover number.  And, that’s what I think they are hiding by pushing the statistically questionable volume through the tape.

Obviously, the estimated adjusted days to cover is loose extrapolation based on my opinion.

In my opinion the lead short seller has gotten the price to trade down to the algorithms in the moving average bands where he is able to find new sellers into which he can start covering.  The number of open out of the money calls has increased dramatically over the past couple months as well.  The options specialist is taking on the risk. Even though the responsibility for repurchasing those 6.3 million shares seems to be shifting to a broader group of short sellers, they have to cover at some point – from whom though?

##Then again?

Maybe this entire short battle has been a rouse.  It’s possible that someone large has sold short on shore 6 million shares to other entities in their control which are off shore thus manufacturing an “in” and then they could have started to buy a boat load (official finance 301 term) of out of the money calls stopping them out of their short.  It may be labor intensive, but at the end they’ll have made a 25% position.

##Why I think the game is over for the shorts?

Unit count, institutional awareness, and popular awareness.

We have been sourcing EV production count articles in China which lead us to believe the projects are moving forward.

<http://www.thestreet.com/story/12741621/1/kandi-not-tesla-will-dominate-chinas-electric-car-market-stocktwits.html>

Kandi’s EV dominance is even forcing Jim Cramer’s The Street.com who now sources Stocktwits for its content to admit what we’ve known for our investors for years.  Kandi can develop pop culture ticker name recognition as the pied piper effect kicks in.

Major institutions have been [starting and / or adding KNDI](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/kndi/institutional-holdings).

EV subsidies in [Hangzhou are expected to begin soon](http://www.0car0.com/xnynews/xnyhy/2014/0612/191622.html). Subsidies would dramatically accelerate unit count, but the policies of removing old cars from the road and reducing ICE license plates seem to be driving adoption for car share and bulk leasing.

 

##End Game for KNDI?

The rollout of EV programs has been fluid, but progressing. Subsidies are in the process of being implemented. This is China, so “Soon” may have many different meanings spanning from “retroactively to never”. 

“Supportive Policies” have begun.  In the west, when we see letters of intent promising supportive policies for a 20,000 vehicle program, we think ‘Oh the government is going to buy them’.  Not so. 

In China, “Supportive Policy” apparently loosely translates to “We will shoot your competitor.”  <http://news.ifeng.com/a/20140619/40808369_0.shtml>

Hangzhou has capped internal combustion engine license plates to approximately 6600 new plates per month while leaving EV plates unlimited. May 2014 there were 280,000 applications for the 6600 license plates.  Kandi’s Micro-Bus cars also known as the car share program cars, are allowed to use the bus lanes circumventing traffic jams, and China is red-lining older cars taking 5 million off the road with legislation pending to take 13 million off the road.

In the near term, I think the Chinese government is sensing that they can shift demand without actually writing the subsidy checks.  These policy shifts seem to have thawed the EV market place just enough for Kandi to get their QBEx cars out into the market place.  QBEx being the industry standard seems to be the end goal.

The cars we are seeing going out into the market place are both plug in and battery exchange.  Thus the battery exchange model is getting pulled into existence.

There are and have been concerns that Kandi does not have a M1 license and thus is just a parts supplier.  In actuality this mandates that they are an integrator of industry players while implementing an industry standard.  They have been positioned to be a supporter to all and competitor to none. Geely through the JV is on board with QBEx.  Zyote has recently debuted a QBEx model for Hangzhou’s leasing program.  That makes 2 “competitors” who are in the QBEx camp.

Kandi through its Jinhua factory should sell many EV into the Jinhua and Hangzhou markets along with supplying parts to the Geely JV.  While Kandi through the Geely JV should sell many many more EV.  Those numbers are becoming quantifiable for investors who want to do the analysis.

The blue sky yet to be recognized is the marketplace of Chinese auto manufacturers who will have to find a way to partner with KNDI or license the QBEx technology from Kandi. Any way you slice it, plug in is awful and QBEx offers a recurring taxable revenue stream.

The further out blue sky yet to be recognized is the relationships which follow behind China’s purchasing of electric utilities globally. QBEx is a turnkey solution which can be implemented by every electric utility globally allowing them to go head to head with the petroleum industry.
