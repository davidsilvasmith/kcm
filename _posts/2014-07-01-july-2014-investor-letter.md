## Recent History
 
As the indexes which are most commonly touted in the media are pushing new highs, for our investors we have been adopting a more conservative stance into the rise.

There’s a lot going on in the world which looks like complete chaos, but the temperament of the people who protect money is still quite complacent.  

Our conservative shift can be likened to being at a good party and leaving the dance floor to sit at a table closer to the door.  We haven’t left the party, but we are aware that the end of festivities comes with a price for those who linger too long.
 
## Marginalizing of Middle East Oil Production
 
Piece it together folks. 

President Obama was very restrictive with Gulf oil production after the BP oil spill, while giving billions to Brazilian companies to assist with generating oil production.  President Obama flat out rejected the Keystone pipeline.  Both bring upward pressure on oil prices and more shale production.

President Obama finds himself in a rift with Saudi Arabia where the Saudi’s made a public statement to the effect that they should consider finding another protector.   Remember it was President Nixon who pledged to defend the House of Saud if they denominated oil sales in U.S. Dollars.  The media buzzwords to follow are “end of petrodollar”.

Mix in some proxy wars with Russia further destabilizing the region.  Russian energy production benefits from decreased Middle East energy production. Keep in mind Russia was the country who gave the United States the names of the Boston Marathon Bombers, and Russia shares a space station with the US.  We aren’t exactly adversaries.  More like co-conspirators.
 
Russia arms Syria’s Assad.  The US arms Syrian Rebels against Assad.  The Rebels rename themselves ISIS and make a sharp turn into Iraq where Russia sells jets to Malaki.  

So what happens if rival factions of Muslims begin fighting each other over refineries and oil fields?  Production disruption and they defund themselves through destroying their own revenue. The world would never forgive the US if we simply bombed the Iraqi oil fields and took our troops home.  But we can foster a situation where the Muslims do it to themselves.

After shortages, Russia’s revenue goes up.
 
Now we find out that President Obama has lifted the ban on US exporting certain types of Oil.  The US is an Oil Exporter now.

Mix in the timing of China shifting to LNG/CNG for trucks and launching their EV initiatives along with the US beginning to shift long haul trucking to LNG from diesel while starting to seed in EV’s like the Leaf and the Spark.
 
For KCM Investors we’ve been strongly positioned for this shift to Chinese EV and US semi-truck LNG/CNG.


## Germany Still Wants Her Gold Back

The pithy summary:  The US is storing Germany’s gold for safe keeping from the risk of WWII reconstruction instability.  The last audit was conducted supposedly in 1950.  The US is supposed to have 1500 tons of Germany’s gold. The Germans were able to repatriate 5 tons in 2013 and guesstimate being able to repatriate 300 tons by 2020.
 
It seems, we’ve lent it out. And whomever borrowed it, lent it out again. And so on.
 
That makes me uncomfortable holding paper gold such as exchange traded funds which own the rights to gold.  Who knows if they can get the gold either?
 
But it appears as though there is a significant sustained demand for gold. Re-hypothecation a proxy for alchemy; looks like we’ll have to dig for more gold to adorn Frau Merkel.

For some of our investors we’ve started a position which would benefit from a sustained demand of increased gold production.  Below is a chart of the Gold Miners Index.  Miners are trading around a long term low.

## From The Troll Battle Front
 
Our children and grandchildren will be living in a world much more honorable than we’ve ever imagined.
 
Technology bringing us instant truth started with the dash board camera on police cars.  In watching the IRS email destruction folly, it’s plainly obvious that anyone who holds and abuses a position of power will be fully illuminated as we move into the future.

Now we have an app allowing us at a glance to find who has funded our favorite politician.
 
##Epiphany of Speaking Souls
 
*(In editing this section, I know it seems like I’m 15 years late on this….  But please stay with me, it sets a very important guiding concept for investing decisions for the next 20 years.)*

There is so much going on in the world right now, shifting. Lots of shifting.  There are a few major themes in the shifting which are going to establish the tone for a while. 

First is the remake of the Middle East.  To me China Russia and the US are acting collusively to shift away from Middle East oil production and hence defund the Middle East anti-globalist disruptors.

Second is the Battle against the Trolls.  Technology has made it impossible to morph the truth.  As we watch the IRS email destruction debacle unfold, nearly unanimously, the entire world threw the B.S. Card upon hearing the “hard drive crashed”.

The revolutionary force which guides the world forward along a path of goodness….   Chat/chat-like communications.  *“Wow…. Prescient…..  Todd you are a genius……..”*   I deserve that…  just stick with me here.

Well, it’s a little bigger than that.  I was chatting with a buddy this morning, and out of my fingers came the words, ***“Cyberspace allows us to communicate with out the prejudices humans carry about one another. It allows us to speak directly soul to soul”***.  This was to a friend whom is older. I’ve never seen him. Don’t know his race, his attributes.  Got some life history out of him, but have a very good idea of his attitudes and thoughts.
 
Throughout the day, I had contact with a friend in Philadelphia (whom I’ve never met), a new acquaintance in Dubai, and a text conversation with a long time close friend as he was travelling in the UK.  All finger-tip conversations as if we were passing notes desk to desk in high school.
 
I had been working on a larger article on the death of trolls in our society.  Illustrating technology cataloguing the truth being the death of trolls.  But with that one statement, the concept broadened into “what force” will guide our society’s culture going forward.
 
With cyber communications, we speak soul to soul without prejudice, and do so with the ability to include vast amounts of souls who all will judge commentary as right or wrong instantly.
 
When you strip people of their prejudices and proclivities as they speak, it’s pretty easy to get to an instant consensus on right vs wrong.   Mix instant consensus with instant dissemination of the truth and the world starts looking pretty bright…… after we finish culling the trolls who wish to use their power disingenuously.
 
This pairing is going to drive our future culture shifts.  From this guiding force, we can establish a long term investment thesis based upon unwinding what is not right and adopting what is right and good.
 
There’s a reason political TV ratings are waning. Extraneous academia is withering. Alternative energy sources such as geothermal for electricity are gaining adoption. GM is recalling zillions of cars to clean up “designed obsolescence”.  Eric Cantor got purged.
 
Going forward it’s all about “right and best for the greater good or face an instant mass thumbs down”.
 
## Going Forward
 
I think the world will be very different than the one our fathers knew, but it looks very bright for our kids and grandkids.  We just have to get to the other side of this historical transition where the people who bring efficiency to uncertain situations can begin hammering out the hiccups.
 
I have very strong concerns about the market frothiness which has been driven by the fed ‘priming the pump’ for so, so, so long.  Car financing will get back to 8% some time.  Mortgages will get back to 8% some time.
 
“Guarded participation” is the way I view our exposure.  We have to participate because the money is flowing.  But we also see the money is flowing due to an unsustainable source.  We are somewhere between “you have to ride the trend” and “you have to sell high”.
 
Blessings,
