##Recent History
 
Over the past three newsletters, I’ve chronicled KCM’s shift from the end is around the corner, to the end is near, to we’ve raised cash for our managed accounts.
 
As most of the world is just now waking up to the reality that the markets are dancing without a floor, KCM is starting to bottom feed.   
 
##A Blistering Fast Reset
 
It’s a “sell-off”. It’s a “crash”. It’s a “manipulation”.      No!!!!....... It’s a reset!!  

And, not the Apocalypse paranoia type either.  In one fell swoop, the markets are factoring in a shift back to humans supporting the market. 
 
Unlike 2000 we don’t have rooms full of hundreds of bank owned prop traders creating ripples and bumps along support levels. The CME’s recent rule 575 has put some necessary collars on HFT activity.  Brokers calling to ask for purchases of individual stocks has largely been replaced by the request to put your money in the hands of professional fund managers.  The retail investors really haven’t returned since 2008. HFT’s have destroyed most brand new warm-blooded traders with great efficiency. The markets seem to be trading quite cleanly. 

It feels like Pro vs Pro.  Under a fed QE supported market, the pros chased the liquidity.  The As Seen On TV indexes got bought up in response to fed liquidity. This in turn supported a handful of very visible stocks.
 
Without the fed support, the pros have to read 10q’s again to find value in their investments.
 
It seems as though supportive bids are being placed at value vulture levels and there’s just not much support in between where prices were trading with QE and where they will be trading as well learned investors step in to absorb all available supply.
 
With very few delusional buyers in the market bidding in hope somewhere in between where things were and where things need to be, this should be a rather expedient reset of pricing levels across the markets.
 
##Econ 201 Oil Price War
 
Periodically we see stories about oil price levels needed for oil producing nations to support their national spending.  What’s overlooked is the actual cost of extracting a barrel from the ground.  It’s when price falls below production cost that wells gets capped; not whether oil kings can pay their welfare.

“They (ISIS) sell it for $30 a barrel because it's a black market. It's not pegged to international standards for oil prices, which are over $100 a barrel. The oil is bought through Turkey from Syria, and it's sold to black market traders who function throughout the Levant.”
 
As you are driving this weekend, enjoying gas falling below $3 per gallon.  Ask yourself, why exactly is the US sending arms to the Syrian militants when it is an easy leap to expect the weapons to be used by Al Queda and ISIS elsewhere? 
 
Sometimes it takes a little time before the truth of a situation starts to come out.  The enemy of my enemy is my frienemy????  As ISIS becomes the establishment…. Will they really want to kill their oil customers or just the other oil kings?
 
 
##Krajniak Economic Theory   
White Paper to Come This Winter

* To have a viable economic system, excess wages and speculative capital must be forced into the hands of the underclass.  

* The proficient will always harvest and accumulate if there is cash flow to accumulate.

* The most powerful force in business is the human bond of gratitude which is formed when one human alleviates life’s oppressing burdens from another liberating the second to prosper.
 

From living in Michigan a union autoworker state, let me simply ask; when an auto worker
pushing a broom can squeak by on $2,000 per month, what happens when he’s paid $6,000 per month?

First he borrows $800 per month for a new car and all the carrying costs pushing through the economy that come with the car.  Well that’s second, first he goes to the bar and drops $80 on dinner and beer payday Friday night along with another $50 on lotto tickets; the bar owner finances a corvette.  Saturday morning he goes to the car dealer; the broom pusher finances a new pickup.  Sunday the broom pusher’s wife escorts him to church; $100 goes into the plate. The church finances a new van. Then it’s off to the Realtor to buy a hunting cabin; The Realtor finances her cliché Cadillac.

More importantly is the need for productive speculative capital; not unguided consumer debt.  The money needs to be put out with purpose, and yes often on a handshake.
 
The most powerful force in business is the human bond of gratitude which is formed when one human alleviates life’s oppressing burdens from another liberating the second to prosper. This is why H Capital thrives.

[H Capital](https://www.hcapitaladvance.com/) is leading the ground up social economic revolution.  In following H Capital loosely since inception on the mention of a lifelong friend, it’s been inspiring to watch from a distance as Amir Landsman has positioned his company to be on the forefront of America’s ground up social economic reshaping.    

Clean-career path people find difficulty empathizing. One needs to experience both sides of the life altering “Thank You” handshake to grasp the magnitude of the gratitude and loyalty driving H Capital’s relationships.

KCM has no relationship with H Capital.  Just illuminating the company who is arguably most prominently positioned to do a lot of good in the world providing avenues forward for the little guy.


##Going Forward

Conceptually, it’s pretty easy.  ISIS is selling oil for $30 a barrel.  Money is going to start hitting the register at gas stations for Slim Jims and soda.  Minivan drivers will be able to afford kids jeans at Kohl’s, Sears and Penny’s this Christmas.  No position, not recommendations.   

Without QE, the dollar is getting stronger, spreads will widen.  Banks will be able to take on riskier loans.  Sure the loans will be at a higher price to the borrower. But the borrowers were locked out before.  It is new money, new jobs.

Markets are resetting with very few speed bumps along the way.  Pros are just going to pay what pros pay for value.  I think we’ll find those levels pretty quickly.  I think the media will scream Apocalypse.  

The masses will be singing “Song of the South”. Someone told us Wall Street fell. We were so poor we couldn’t tell.  Then they’ll find $20 extra in their pocket leaving the gas station.
 
With HFT’s now collared through CME rule 575, warm-blooded traders will start to repopulate the markets.

It looks like we are going to see a big ol’ band aid ripping market event which ends with people going back to work.

For managed accounts, KCM has large cash positions.  We are looking through the carnage for great opportunities.
 
Until next month, be well.
