title: KCM January Investor Letter
excerpt: Over the past year we’ve been playing insanely tight defense.  But the focus is starting to change.  Now that the main market has finally let go a little bit we’ve been able to start putting money back to work in carnage plays for our clients.  Not a lot of money, but a little; an opportunistic first nibble which we don’t think we’ll have to unwind.

##Recent History
 
The markets have been soft for a while. Even though we have probed for footing, we have for quite some time found softness and have subsequently approached the markets gingerly.  Where possible KCM investors have elevated levels of cash.  Now the indexes are finally being allowed to sell off.

##Climate Overview

Market writers have coined the term FANG for Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google.  They have been the beneficiaries in this era of central bank liquidity distortion while much of the rest of the market has sought pricing within the laws of economics.

This chart tallies the percentage of stocks above their 200 day moving average.  Or, stocks in an uptrend.  74% are in a long term downtrend now.

##All Manipulations Clear

My favorite Charles Dow concept.  And that’s basically what we have happening.  For 35 years the Federal Reserve has manually at its dictate adjusted interest rates lower.  Much of the institutional investing community practices a belief system that puts more money into stocks as interest rates go down.  Well, now it’s time to find out where interest rates really belong and at what levels companies are really valued.  

We are unwinding a manipulation that dates back to early Reagan.

##Agendas Working Through the Markets

To keep it brief, this oil war is a fight to the death between Saudi Arabia and Russia.  US has developed its oil infrastructure.  China is moving toward EV.  There are just too many people producing now.   We are expecting to see the Shia and Sunni be allowed to fight without western intervention.  As the world shifts transportation fuel, we will just need less oil.  Russia sells oil.  OPEC sells oil.  And there just won’t be enough customers for them both going forward.  The [destruction](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-06/pray-us-libya-issues-cry-help-isis-advances-oil-fields) of [oil assets](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-airstrikes-blast-isis-oil-facilities-in-syria/) is [now started](http://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-attacks-libyan-oil-refineries-1451914036).

The next major shift working its way through is the need for industry professionals to form a new approach for securities analysis.  Or more likely, participants will need to learn what makes a business owner want to take over a publicly traded company.  Through modern history, the markets have become a playground for well financed people to attempt profiting by pushing prices to desired levels exiting their position on others.  As efficiencies of technology have set in, the well-financed have been able to work toward targeting positions to move such that the human investors would get frustrated and exit their positions at a loss.  The humans pulled back their activity.  Now the well-financed are finding that it is primarily the well-financed trying to edge out the other well-financed. It’s just them. Few humans and fewer people who want to buy entire businesses.  But these pieces of paper we call stocks are rights of ownership possessing real value to someone who would want to purchase the entire company.  The quest is now, “What’s it worth to someone who would want the keys to the building? What can we buy into it at?”

Individual stocks, once they break their guided price trend, are falling to levels where someone might find it worthy of buying the whole company.  So we look there for our investments.

This seems like a logical concept for everyday people to grasp.  But the industry has created a culture where the desire to get an edge blossoms into running operations which create their edge.  That’s unwinding.  The new mindset to prosper is market participants now must become investors who understand which day to day business decisions being executed by corporate managers will drive businesses to be more valuable.  Not financiers parsing elaborate score cards issued by management quarterly after the fact, but actual empathy of which managers are choosing well along the way.  

Universities aren’t very good at teaching students how to think like the guy who signs the front side of a paycheck. 

The third major theme working its way through the market is the adjustment of broader economic pricing levels in general.  At the end of the day all prices reflect what customers are able to pay.  Over the past 35 years, we have replaced wealth creating tasks driving income to customers with credit based purchasing options allowing customers to continue purchasing. People are shunning large screen TV’s bought with credit cards for craft beer. Global chieftains are beginning to realize that we need excess wages available to the working class if they want customers to buy their stuff. This is just starting. It’s going to be a while. Someone is going to figure out that unionization attempts of UBER drivers, work stoppages in China and minimum wage pressure, can all be organized (pardon the pun) globally, socially for profit of the organizers.  By the end of this we will have global unionization pulling excess wages into the working class.
 
##The Debt Slaves Left

It all ties together.  Over the last 2 years in the markets more often than not, when something has been allowed to sell off it has sold off 60% or more.  People can only pay with as much as they have to spend. Those that believed in institutional finance’s mindset that we can push prices up through central bank support for 35 years, while gutting wages of workers are finding out that the workers quit playing the game.  Ok, if we can only afford beer…….  …  there is a lot of really good beers being made now; pure nectar.

##The Wailing 

How this plays out?  We’ll likely hear copious amounts of media wailing about economic collapse.  We’ll continue to drink coffee and beer buying little of substance. Our Rome has already burned.

If a tree falls in the woods with no one around does it make a sound?  If everyone is out but the predators when the markets fall, does anyone stop living their existing lives in reality-ville? If no one watches CNBC does Steve Liesman make a sound?

##The Great Rotation

Copper, Gas, Oil, Agriculture have been allowed to fall first and farthest.  They will ultimately price at levels consumers can afford to pay on their current incomes.  The indexes were held up until we’ve found levels of deep value pricing in the commodities.  I’m a believer in guided market events; no one suspends trillions of dollars at random.  It really seems to me that the indexes were held up until there were places to put the money needing to come out of Facebook, Apple, Google and the rest. 

We seem to be in the area were abstainer’s remorse is kicking in.  A few weeks back, natural gas was trading down to $1.90 or so.  I remember looking at UNG a natural gas fund when it was trading under $7 and was too timid to start the position.

##Going Forward

The market is moving into what we see as the healthy correction.  Everyday people are focused on being everyday people living everyday lives enjoying time with others. It seems as though the only ones who haven’t reconciled their existence to the new realities are the central bankers and financiers who have been practicing financial engineering.  Financial Engineering is PC for market manipulation. 

As the narrow swaths of pricing which resonate on TV touted indexes and in 401k’s begin taking their turns at reconciling to the new reality, Central Banks still seem to be inclined to attempt intervention making it difficult to position well for downside movement.  It’s like saying a marionette is being allowed to rest on the stage only to have it randomly ripped upward by the puppet master. 

We are patiently digging for undervalued companies either because their price has become fundamentally attractive or their business is on a path of improvement which makes the current pricing an attractive discount. In this environment we are not afraid to sit with cash until we find acceptable positions.
After the harsh selloff the fun begins.  

##Coffee or Meat
 
Everyone is welcome, clients and non-clients alike.  If you are watching the horrific stories on TV and fretting about your investments. Give me a call.  We can have coffee at Creole or eat at Meat in Old Town along with putting in some conference table time making sure you are positioned for the current market.
