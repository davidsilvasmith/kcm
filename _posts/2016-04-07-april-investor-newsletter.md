##Recent History

The Fed Raised a quarter point. The markets sold off hard through January and selectively recovered in price through March. Toward the end of the quarter, for managed accounts we were closing long exposure which had run its course. When looking to re-establish lower risk entries, admittedly, it’s been easier to find short positions.

##Omni-Truth

We entered an era of omnipresent truthiness. It started with email evidence chains in the 90’s. Nothing goes away. Cameras and video capture most truths now. It’s catching up to the bureaucratic trolls and political elite. IRS email has been followed by The Panama Papers.
Leadership will simply have to practice stewardship.
The markets and its leaders aren’t immune from the illumination of truths either.

## Mary Jo White’s Half-Complete Conquest

I can’t stress this enough. The SEC under Mary Jo White has gotten some awesome work done with respect to cleaning up the miscreant behaviors within the US Markets. Single stock mini flash crashes have been removed from the market, The Reg Sho Threshold list is now very tiny. A certain blog site notorious for rampant innuendo and half-truths lost their distribution. There’s more. They’ve been busy.

Even so, there are still some issues which need to be corrected before “Rigged” begins to be seen as “Fair”. People have left. B/D’s like Schwab, and TD Ameritrade offer 500 free trades. The IPO market is anemic. Confidence hasn’t been restored. But to finish the task, the SEC may have to think unconventionally.

2 real life scenarios which still have yet to be addressed:

We bought 500 shares of a thinly traded ETF for clients last week. 500 shares were offered at 38.95. We put in a limit order for 500 @ 38.95. The offer immediately lifted to 39 or 39.05. That’s straight out of the Michael Lewis book and it’s still happening.

Short sellers still practice institutionalized manipulation.

A short seller can build out a large position in a company because they deem the company not to have the cash to defend their float. “As a Hedge”, the short seller can then buy large amounts of out of the money calls. This puts the options specialist in a position where it works out best if the share price is pinned below the calls at expiration thus holding down the share price. The short seller can then commission research and have that research disseminated broadly and repeatedly in multiple venues thus conditioning the market. Once the bids for the stock go thin, the short seller can then trade down through the bids manipulating the price of the stock lower and increase the profitability of the large position. All of which is “legal”. But is now fully illuminated and no longer tolerated by the investor class who has embraced the word “Rigged”.

Good shorts can simply take a position and publish their case. Citron’s VRX and Kyle Bass’ UDF short positions come to mind.

On the other hand, if a short seller is practicing follow on trading “working the position” and paying for ongoing research dissemination, those are signs of manipulation to make a positon work. I have TCR numbers if anyone at the agency wants to follow in on the thought.

Investors and Issuers don’t give a flying fig about what legal parsers say; culturally we’ve shifted and legaleeze is no longer seen as a cute success. Our world has changed. Everything is illuminated now. The SEC is cornered. They will have to fully cleanse the markets. This generation of investors isn’t coming back until “Fair” sticks.

The SEC can either keep chasing events as the miscreants morph. Or the SEC can create an environment where the miscreants choose the honorable path as the path of least resistance.

The solution is easy.

##Examiner with a Stammer

Find a securities lawyer with a stammer so thick that he makes Mel Tillis sound like Orson Wells. Yep, I went there.

Stream line the review process for trading improprieties and market manipulation. If the SEC receives a complaint about market makers lifting or short sellers spreading disinformation while trading through the bid. C,C,C, Ca, Ca - Call them. Hold a conversation about their t,..tr.trading.

Send an email prior to the call. Hello, this is the SEC. We have noticed some trading which we would like to discuss. We will call at 9:30 am Tuesday April 2, 2016. During that information gathering call, your firm will be permitted to close any existing positions but asked to refrain from initiating any new positions until we have completed our information gathering.

The last thing someone who is practicing manipulative trading wants is to have their position trade without their shepherding. Good guys, “eh, ok so I’ve got to wait a bit.”

Once the SEC gets into a hand full of “close position trades only” information gathering phone calls with a firm running manipulation schemes, the cost of doing business becomes prohibitive for strategies with poor optics.

No one is going to want to risk putting their entire firm on hold for an unknown amount of conversation time due to poor trading optics.

##Acorns Replace Old Oaks

The dirty little secret about the market is .... .... Companies generally don’t live forever. They merge away or end their existence as the world moves forward.

To survive, the capital markets need new listings. To have a market for issuers, the markets need investors.

The SEC knows this. That’s why they’ve cleansed so much nefarious activity in the first two years of Ms. White’s tenure. I’m confident they’ll keep moving forward in a unprecedented manner. Everything is illuminated now. There is no place for trolls in this world.

##Goodness and Newness!

es, we’re optimists at KCM. Really we are. Hopefully you’ve read this far without opening a window and jumping. If you are prone to jumping, keep a garden level office!!

We are finding a lot of great things pent up within the markets. It would really be helpful if the culture shift we are enduring were completed.

In the past few weeks we’ve discovered 3 ideas we really like. They are early stage and vary in their stage of earliness. I anticipate they will be on our radar for a while.

First is [Kraneshares](http://kraneshares.com/). CIO Brendan Ahern is the pretty sharp fellow who crafted a series of China facing ETFs which slice and dice Chinese markets allowing us to build targeted positions. We’ve started a small position in one of their funds which we hope to be able to expand into as time progresses. Not a recommendation, do your own dd.

BMRA hit our radar.

They are on the front end of FDA testing for an IBS blood test which helps identify which foods are aggravating the IBS. If you’ve ever been involved with IBS, it’s real. It sucks. It doesn’t matter what script docs prescribe, patients still need to eat. Not knowing what food is the real irritant is the crux of the ailment. It’s conceivable that all IBS patients will use the test 2 – 3 times per year while attempting to gain control of the condition.

No position yet. Not a recommendation. Do your own due diligence. It hits our radar at KCM, if the product comes to fruition and does what it says it will, there is a market which must absorb it.

Another name we are hoping to see become available is SRTS or [Sensus Healthcare](http://sensushealthcare.com/). They [postponed](http://www.law360.com/articles/778072/sensus-healthcare-delays-20m-ipo-amid-slumping-market) their IPO, reasons unknown. Sensus has patents and FDA approval on their SRT-100 along with 200 units already on the market. The SRT-100 [radiates](http://sensushealthcare.com/superficial-radiation-therapy/srt-100/) basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and more. No position. Not a recommendation.

##Going Forward

We’re clearly in an out with the old, in with the new market. The out with the old is unwinding just fine. The in with the new part isn’t coming to fruition too easily. The participants of the “in with the new” parts have really voted with their feet. IPO’s aren’t getting funded. Investors are not showing up.

This sets up a dubious situation in otherwise very hopeful times. Until the SEC can establish an environment which resonates as honest and forthright, the “in with the new crowd” are going to do their “in with the new thing” elsewhere.

That being said. We feel compelled to be very conservative with respect to any position which resonates as established or known. And we’ll keep making our list of ideas and concepts which should be well received by reality regardless of market functionality.

All conversations are welcome.
