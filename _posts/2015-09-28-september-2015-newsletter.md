Hello Friends.

*“.....shall, immediately after such execution, display a revised quotation at a price that is inferior..."* - FINRA 6272 ( c)(2)

There used to be a day when humans controlled the functionality of order flow; human pit traders, human market makers, human specialists complete with rules guiding the human emotion decision making process.

Now we have shifted the microstructure to being enacted by very fast computer systems who process against the book making real time math decisions. Those who will prosper in the future will accept that all givens we had known, now need to be reviewed and some may need to be held in a different light.


##The Real Cancer

Spoofing? Got it, check. Front running through latency? Got it, check.

Time Frame Layering?? Yeah, no one is talking about that yet.

This is the activity which is the real cancer. In brief, Time Frame Layering is where someone builds a large position short – long time horizon. And then uses short term algorithms to hit through the bid stack marking down their large long term short position; when necessary paying for negative media to thin out the human hopefuls clogging up the bid.

The plausible explanation, ‘We think the position is fundamentally overvalued. Therefore we short it. We also have pool of capital of such size that we are forced to run multiple algorithm strategies on multiple time frames independent of each other. The fact that the position in question has been successful on both the long term and short term simply proves our thesis is correct.”

Does it matter if the thesis is “The harder you hit humans, the more they sell and run?” The conundrum, some of the time large short sellers are correct. Where’s the line between aggressively pursuing a correct thesis vs creating a vicious cycle because an otherwise viable company does not have the excess liquidity to fight a predatory action?

There’s a pit traders adage, “There’s more money on the short side.” This is because PEOPLE are quicker to stop out protecting capital than they are to initiate positions. If you are starting flat and ending flat, then it’s mathematically more profitable to focus on short positions. If one is committing capital for the longer term, then they need to search for exponential price expansion.

By definition, HFT, High Frequency means they start flat and end flat. Up to thousands of times per second. By argument, an algo server can bring the equivalent order flow of thousands of human short sellers.

Back in the day, it was said, 70% of the humans had a long bias. Work that thought back a bit to find a feel for the number of positions initiated short or the number of short selling participants could be a mish mash somewhere in the other 30%. Let’s pick 15% of the participants at any time were short sellers simply for initiating the concept in conversation. Of that 15% how many were automated? How many were in the pits with unlimited size / frequency? So, 6 to 1 long vs short?

Today we’ll hear high numbers of volume being attributed to HFT. 60%+ of the tape? You pick the percentage. When you see individual stocks on occasion churn multiples of their float during daily sessions, I think the guess on percentage is irrelevant. It’s pert-near 100% whenever the algo operators want it to be. Yes that would imply trading with themselves.

Circling back to Time Frame Layering. Humans flinch when they see funky downside activity. Once they are out, they sit out to wait for selling to stop before they will re-establish.

Once humans flinch, the bid stack thins. Algos tapping at the best bid find the thin ice and push through. The long term short position gets marked down. Humans are confused, they back away. More selling ensues. The vicious cycle continues until someone choses to absorb all sellers.

Can’t fault the HFT’s. If the environment is structured to permit certain activities, then the activities will be enacted.

##The Floor Has Moved

In equities, .9 price to book would be a great starting point for value buyers. Now it’s .5. Providing someone would want to buy all the stock to get the keys to the building and run the company for themselves.

If the company doesn’t have the liquidity to battle the algo shorts by taking back stock or is attractive to an acquirer, they are toast.

Stocks used to move 3 ways, ‘Up, down and sideways’. Due to algos omnipresent seeking bid stack failure, we now have ‘If not up, then down’. For a stock to appreciate, there needs to be an ever present stream of new bids to offset the omnipresent pecking for price attrition. Once the bids thin, then the down kicks in. There’s no sideways anymore.

Once the downward movement kicks in, then comes multiple downside algos trading short timeframe short positions. Whatever you say, do not call this collusion or trading amongst themselves to mark a position lower. These are simply mindless trading programs acting on market conditions. Their success is because price movement obviously proves they have a correct thesis. Just ask the algo operators, they’ll explain it.

Circling back again to the ratio of long trader to short traders. Sure algos go both ways based on what’s working. But once the humans flinch and back away from the bid, one direction works. Now what’s that percentage of short to long participant? We’ll use the low whisper. If 60% of the tape is HFT and 40% is human. Then 70% of the humans being long only means 28% are long. 12% of the tape could then be human short. But that 60% can churn several times the float of any stock in either direction. In this case the ratio can skew to 12% human long vs Infinity short.

Once the bids break, the algo onslaught is omnipotent.

The premeditative motive is a lot more difficult to prove than spoofing. It goes unexamined.

##Examples Absurdity and Beyond

Spartan Motors makes the list because they are on the front end of this HFT tap down process. Volume has waned. They are trading around .85 price to book. Sales and Net Income increased on the last 10q. In their [institutional road show](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FileName=0001437749-15-016704.txt&FilePath=%5C2015%5C09%5C01%5C&CoName=SPARTAN%20MOTORS%20INC&FormType=8-K&RcvdDate=9/1/2015&pdf=) they are touting their Continual Improvement culture which is driving cost reductions.

![]( /images/posts/2015-09-28-september-2015-newsletter/Issuer_Epiphany_9.28.2015v2_Page_03_Image_0001.jpg)

￼￼￼Their float is well held by institutions. It’s the scenario where a handful of participants can trade a few shares back and forth to mark down the price. No one has stepped in to stop this process. But that’s just ugly getting uglier portion of the Spartan story.

The “Hey what’s going on over here?” half is the connection to UQM. KCM has no position in either SPAR nor UQM. Neither are recommendations. Spartan is geographically close to our office. We just don’t want to create the opportunity of having to defend that we could have inadvertently come across material nonpublic information through friends or neighbors.

You see, John Stzykiel former CEO of Spartan is a member of UQM’s board. UQM has for a long time made really cool alternative energy drivetrain type products for customers like the US Military. They have just not been able to execute on establishing extended distribution. Now their financials are pretty gutted.

<http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/uqm-technologies-receives-increased-orders-from-zenith- motors-for-powerphase-pro-135-electric-moto-20150812-00358>

*￼￼￼￼“UQM powered Zenith Electric Shuttle Vans are CARB approved and now
￼eligible for up to $50,000 incentives under California Air Resource Board
￼Hybrid Truck and Bus Voucher Program.”*

Well, that’s quaint. But so what?

<http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/zenith-motors-signs-major-dhl-express-usa-electric-delivery- truck-deal-increases-orders-of-uqm-20150923-00269>

Now DHL is sourcing UQM drivetrain trucks. It’s small so what?

Well Stzykiel who’s father was a founder of Spartan, is still a large shareholder in Spartan and not yet totally removed from the company. Spartan amongst its many really cool specialty vehicles like the Starbux catering trucks, manufactures UPS’ Big Brown Trucks.

So how does Stzykiel connect these dots? If UQM can produce drivetrains which are good enough for the military and DHL,... And UPS has committed shifting towards alternative fuels like LNG, CNG and RNG for its heavy duty rigs one of 3 things can happen: UPS might not actually want the EV drivetrain, or Spartan as a customer sources the UQM drive train for UPS trucks, or Stzykiel finds a way to bring Spartan and UQM closer together.

It’s an exciting set of dynamics for a pair of such decimated companies. Even so, SPAR is currently receiving little respect.

Next,... We are still long KNDI. Not a recommendation. This will likely be the most absurd situation I see in my career.

In 2014 I wrote a white paper outlining the HFT counterfeiting and self trading had inflated volume for the purpose of masking the true days to cover. There was an SEC Subpoena delivered to the company in Nov 2014 which concluded with a no action letter for the company but the statistically impossible HFT volume abruptly reduced to just highly elevated trading levels. The trading tactics of the shorts has changed to only use mega volume for overwhelming buyers for the purpose of marking the stock down after news events and then resort to buying shares and tapping away at the bid the rest of the time.

Well, volume has waned as they’ve driven it lower effectively trading with themselves. Now they are at [23.68 days to cover](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/kndi/short-interest). They haven’t created massive selling as they had hoped because there are thousands of articles from Chinese media linked at the KNDI yahoo private message board. Chinese pollution still exists. The EV shift is beginning. The long term shareholders still seem to be holding strong.

![]( /images/posts/2015-09-28-september-2015-newsletter/Issuer_Epiphany_9.28.2015v2_Page_06_Image_0001.jpg)

￼I still believe one can easily look at intraday periods of trading when short seller(s) aren’t working their position and deduce that real volume is significantly lower and the days to cover likely multiples than the recently reported 23.6 days.

Some of the reasons why we’re still holding KNDI:

Chairman Hu worked within China’s National 863 program where he left with Quick Battery Exchange patents which were developed while he was employed there. Who is ever allowed to leave their employer with actionable patents? He then transferred the patents to KNDI.
After allowing Hu to leave with patents, years later the PRC is now prepaying EV subsidies to KNDI’s manufacturing JV for the purchase of EV’s manufactured with those battery patents.
The world thinks China’s auto industry is collapsing. In reality ownership controls are beginning to be placed on ICE vehicles through license plate restrictions driving (pun intended) consumer choices towards EV and Kandi’s Micro Public Transport vehicles.
While the Chinese Government is prepaying subsidies for EV’s developed using patents created in their agency, there is a 23 Days to Cover 20.9% short position open. The days to cover is arguably much higher when you factor out short traders efforts to cycle selling through the bids. As I discussed last year, at some point the shorts uncomfortable position eventually becomes well illuminated.
The list goes on and on, but for the sake brevity here, the KNDI yahoo private group has compiled thousands of articles from China cataloguing the company and many thorough discussions illuminating the company’s progress in curing balance sheet concerns.

Rounding out this sample of absurdity. Let me start with a question.

If Chicago or New York, or anywhere with an established Medallion revenue stream begins to lose 10%, 20% or more of their Medallion fees because E-hail services like Uber drive the Street Hail taxi cab providers out of business, how long will it take before the cities decide they need to find a way to recoup that lost revenue?

![]( /images/posts/2015-09-28-september-2015-newsletter/Issuer_Epiphany_9.28.2015v2_Page_07_Image_0001.jpg)

￼To the surprise of few Uber lovers, TAXI which does Medallion Financing has gotten hit. Medallion loan delinquencies and defaults are rising rapidly. Across the industry Medallion debt portfolios are stressed.

It’s absurd to think that revenue reclamation won’t become a priority for the municipalities. Once we see the effort by tax collectors to recoup their lost revenue from the E-Hail providers, then the Medallion portfolios will stabilize.

In the meantime, TAXI has recently [announced a $26 million](http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150916/taxi8-k.html) share buyback program. This is approximately 1⁄2 of their cash.

KCM has no position in TAXI and not a Recommendation. This buyback plan is resonating as only half the solution necessary. It’s on our radar though.

BPI $275 mm cash. $350 mm market cap. No position not a recommendation.

##The Exchanges’ Buggy Whip Catalyst

With issuers, a third are coming, a third are staying and a third are going.

The third of issuers that are going, they’re gone anyway.

The third of issuers that are coming. That’s going to slow as our culture has shifted. Michigan Mile Act in response to the Jobs Act along with Reg A+ skew startup funding away from the IPO path. A simple State filing, mix in some crowd funding effort and.... wallah!!! Who needs to spend on Sarbanes?

Here’s the death nail to exchanges......

Take a wholesome company like Spartan Motors. They are just a well-run company dedicated to continuous improvement trading at a discount to book. How long do you think it will take before wholesome companies of Spartan’s caliber begin exploring becoming a Non-Reporting OTC:BB like KEWL (no position, not a recommendation) and regularly post audited financial statements? It’s a social media world; communicate directly with shareholders.

SPAR was chosen for example because they are wholesome and getting worked lower without pushback by algorithms. Remember stocks no longer move sideways and if the float is happily owned, a handful of traders can walk the price down by just bouncing back and forth few shares all day long. SPAR / UQM also gives brain candy to research focused managers.

In a non-reporting OTC environment, to support the stock price all they’d have to do is redirect their compliance, reporting and IR spend toward implementing a continuous buyback program. A sustained linear decrease in float brings an exponential increase in book value attributed to shares available for trading.

If they were to put $200,000 per month into continuous float reduction, they’d lose their volume, but they’d have more certainty at recapturing their multiple. Paying a dividend, buying shares and no algo onslaught; doesn’t take too many human investors to value the company fairly. As for the need to be on an exchange to participate in funding.... If quality companies begin to exit the exchanges, those that need to lend will follow the deal flow.

I know choosing to go Non-Reporting OTC:BB has been seen as a lot of things historically, none positive. But, how long before issuers decide paying $Millions for recourseless public slander, preemptive prosecution and discounted multiples becomes the new definition of insanity?

Solid issuers don’t have to stay captive. The exchanges are facing challenges maintaining the human order flow portion of the social contract to provide a venue between issuers and investors. It’s a thumbs up, thumbs down instant truth world now. We lost 1000 points in a day and the world reacted with the detachment of non-participation. Because the humans have left the building.

If quality issuers begin to choose delisting, it will take 1⁄2 a day for our shop or any other techie to write a screener which searches on the terms Stock Buy Back, OTC:BB, Non-Reporting, Net Income > 0.

Once the lightbulb clicks that technology and social media mean solvent issuers have options, then the third which traditionally stay will explore those options leaving the exchanges with 1⁄2 that are coming, 1⁄2 that are going and a bunch of ETTs holding paper precious metals.

## Equity as a Currency

For those who choose to maintain their listing, they will have to battle the dual onslaught of math favoring the HFT short seller and FINRA 6272( c)(2). This is dynamic is relatively new to large cap, but well incubated in microcap and metastasizing higher through the more liquid issues.

The companies will figure out at .5 price to book whether they like it or not, they have to do share buybacks. Then the CFO’s will say, “Uh what do we do with this stock? We’ve just tied up our cash.” Logically they will then use shares to supplement expenses such as bonuses, vendor payouts, or acquisitions. Because cash is fungible. Eventually they will come to like tying stock up as restricted stock units creating scarcity.

The word liquidity is in jeopardy of no longer being viewed as a positive because issuers will understand that the more certificates they have floating greater enables short sellers’ ability to borrow stock for the purpose of hitting through the humans.

Eventually they’ll circle around to the realization that they will have keep a bid under their own stock at all times to fight off the algo cancer.

There used to be a day when stocks moved up, down or sideways. Now it’s “If not up, then down”. In theory I could own 1⁄2 SPAR and John Stzykiel could own all but 1000 shares of the other half of Spartan Motors. We could both have the shares tied up in kids and grandkids accounts. If neither of us acted in either direction any other 2 people could short the other 1000 shares back and forth between each other driving the price down into the pennies. If someone came in and tried to buy 20,000 shares, a market maker could fill the order short “stabilizing the stock”. Once the 3rd buyer finished, the market maker could walk the spread down until the third owner stopped out of their 20,000 shares. Now mix in algos which peck away at the bid looking for thin ice. Sure it’s oversimplified and extreme, but it illustrates cleanly the process which makes it necessary for an ongoing bid in order to prevent price multiple erosion.

Just as market making has gone binary in nature; stand and fill human inflow or probe for bids. Human investors will come to see stocks as either dilutive or anti-dilutive in nature as a search criteria.

KNDI and SPAR are in similar situations. Their stocks seem to be well held and getting worked down around the complacency. SPAR is just off the radar of the few remaining human investors. KNDI has an active short seller scaring new buyers away. Both companies could benefit from a buyback plan which is sustained over a long time frame. TAXI just came out with a large buyback program which leaves me concerned about what happens next once they quit taking stock. In my opinion, the trick is for the company to create something that investors can believe will continue for a very long time. BPI why wouldn’t they go non reporting OTC and allocate the listing cost to repurchase shares?

All of this eventually circles back around to the questions:

“What is the value proposition for maintaining an exchange listing, if we have to spend $millions and then underwrite the value of the stock ourselves?”

“As an non-reporting OTC company, can we just put the market makers bid ask spread on our website or link to it on every electronic publication or email we generate?”

Just my opinion on how I see all this playing out. Unless of course there are some restorative actions taken.

## The Push Back

There will always be people / institutions who need to have money in the markets. These people will take positions providing support and asset price appreciation.”

To a certain extent I agree. Prices will get crushed down to a level where humans provide an indestructible level of support. Even so, if a public pension fund runs approximately 100 positions there are still another 4000 or more companies which are subject to needing to battle the algos on their own. Of those 4000, a portion will be coming, a portion will be going and those who are self-sufficient will find it a challenge to accept compressed multiples.

As the conventional mindset argues, there are always people who need to invest. And... There will always be people with ideas which need funding. With instant electronic media providing for omnipresent truth, they can now pair up in venues other than the legacy exchanges.

It’s time for the Exchanges to revisit their value proposition.

## Curing the Human Hunting Preserve

Short selling is not the issue. Short sellers quite often do good work. As we see necessary, we sell short. HFT shops, can’t blame them. If I had their life paths in front of me, I probably would have made the same operational choices they have. Unfortunately I just don’t see how issuers and investors continue to participate in an environment where certain technologies and rules skew advantages so dramatically.

Humans by nature will go to where humans can prosper. Right now we simply have a microstructure designed to eviscerate all humans through paper cuts, downside pressure and occasional wallops. This started with microcap in 2011 and has metastasized up to large cap, futures and the indexes. Eventually this process runs to a conclusion as a very fast vending machine with little quality inventory and few end customers. Just machines cannibalizing each other while the anointed few institutional accepted stocks have enough sponsorship to survive.

In order to preserve their business, the exchanges have to revert back to accepting only market, stop and limit orders entered by hand. One human, one hand, one order at time. If the exchanges want human investors to interface with human issuers they need to orchestrate a fair human vs human fight instead of selling privileged access to the automated human hunting preserve.

Anyone really holding their breath? I’m not. Hopefully the exchanges catch on, but I see this scenario playing out like an empty video game parlor that gets sold to private equity groups who run late stage unwinds until they wither completely. Prudent investors will make prudent choices to participate elsewhere. As advisors we’ll have to keep abreast of the shift. Other venues will rise which fairly match human vs human.

Then again, maybe as the issues are illuminated, the legacy infrastructure people will come to review their value proposition. If they don’t, the trajectory is for there to be a few hundred stocks which could be institutionally friendly, a cluster of companies which incorporate their float as a currency used within their operations, and then most of the other 4000 companies just make other arrangements.
