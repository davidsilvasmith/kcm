##Recent History

Happy December!  

For managed accounts until very recently we’ve had to navigate tumultuous activity in individual stocks.  Much of the activity has resonated as low human participation allowing algorithm trading programs to run amok moving prices violently up and down without logic. On the back side of the entropy we’re beginning to see the embattled landscape come to a consensus in direction and logic. 

Algorithm trading programs which bring downward pricing pressure are becoming more prominent.  It’s not my intent to sound like an alarmist. There’s just a new way of doing business that has been creeping up through the market.  It’s now front and center. The reality is, we have to respect that things are changing and we need to be prepared.

Managed accounts have been positioned for weakening asset prices.

##Central Bank Marginalization

It’s been 30 years in the making.  We used to have 18% mortgages back in the 70’s.  Every economic slowdown since has been met with reducing interest rates to ensure people who live off their investments didn’t share the economic cycle pain felt by the laboring class.  Eventually we’ve come to 0% Fed rates and quantitative easing.  It hasn’t stopped at QE.

With the Fed ending published asset buying in October, there has been a coordinated effort by the central banks of Japan, US, Europe and China to prop up or re-prime the markets.  These efforts range from asset purchases, liquidity injections, a rate cut and significant jawboning about intended supportive actions like a European QE 4.

China has since responded to its overheating market with restrictive action, and European Central Bank public intentions of more asset purchases have found no political support.  This leaves the US and Japan to do the lifting of the indexes in the name of “preventing deflation”.

Other than direct asset purchase to peg indexes to a predetermined level the Central Banks are running out of bullets to support the indexes.  If the Fed wants a certain price level, they are going to have to directly support the indexes.

In the absence of the Fed pegging asset prices to a desired target, algorithms will likely continue to control the price path of the indexes and much of the rest of the underlying market.  More ugliness ahead.  Mind you though, the Fed just has to hit a button but then it’s trapped supporting the indexes until it’s ready to accept blame for collapsing the indexes by removing support.

##Author’s Edit:

Since originally writing this December 16, we have had the Federal Reserve use words like “patience” juicing the algorithm buying programs.  Followed by Switzerland announcing a negative interest rate policy at 2 AM Eastern Time spurning a 480 point up day on the DJ-30.

This was promptly followed by Sweden announcing their move to negative interest rates.

While western central banks are grasping at ropes trying to create inflation the emerging countries are pushing equally as hard the other way.  Russia went to 17%, Nigeria 13% and Belarus shut off Forex trading.

In trading 12/23, bonds have started to sell off here in the States and Biotechs have just suffered their first signs of distribution as well.  When the western central bank cabal resorts to Sweden announcing NIRP on a weekend to try to prevent low prices from curing low prices, confidence in their ability to keep this going starts to get thin.

Also we had a 5% GDP number.  It looks like most of it went to Obamacare with everything being real looking nearly flat.  As someone who is in the exchange with a family to insure, the Obama care numbers really feel like a land grab for government subsidies; any entity who can lay claim to head count seems to be registering bodies and billing the Federal Government.  After things settle in, we are likely to find out that much of that 12% increase for Obamacare has been double counting, double billing which needs to be paid back.

What sell off?  China and Japan have this round covered.  The welfare continues.

##Addiction to Algorithms

Exchanges have embraced the shift to algorithms; fewer humans, more volume.  It seems the addiction afflicted Arrogancia forgot this is a people business which needs happy prospering people participating in order for the industry and their quaint exchanges to survive.

Here’s the crux, people scare easier selling out positions much quicker than they are inspired to put money into the markets.  It’s more profitable for highly active traders to trade short looking for positions where people are likely to feel the need to sell out quickly. Thousands of times per second, algorithms trade stocks.  For algorithms, the math is more profitable attempting to trade stocks in a manner which profits from downside price movement.

In an oversimplification, algorithm success stems from the ability to create uncertainty within trading.  Prices move too quickly and shift at price points illogical to humans.  This makes it difficult for human managers to control their risk.  They back away until they have greater certainty.  When humans pull their bids due to uncertainty, this allows algorithms to follow the path of greatest profit pushing prices down until the next level where humans are bidding.  This process continues until there is an overwhelming level of human support.
 
This process becomes a vicious cycle.  The quicker prices move to the downside, the more inclined humans become to hold out until the selloff is done before bidding.  This force brings an entire cadre of other predatory market behavior.  All of which has been very destructive to smaller companies which have fewer active shareholders and more broadly it’s been very destructive to humans wanting to participate in the markets.
 
With the central banks now marginalized in their efforts to support the markets tips the balance of strength in favor of the algorithms acting in the made for TV indexes, DJ-30, S&P-500, and NASDAQ 100. 
Just like heroine, the exchanges’ algo addiction is shifting from euphoric to self-destructive.

Before, algo price destruction was a problem localized with the lesser known stocks. If a poor guy screams about losing money on Wall Street,…….?  Now, this algo price destruction process has exacerbated the selloff in oil down to industry crushing price levels.  This activity is metastasizing into the high yield credit markets. For the first time, algorithms squarely control the price movement of the equity indexes.

Once humans who invest in indexes become confused and flinch as they have this past week, the vicious cycle accelerates. Downward pressure will continue until we find a level where humans step in to absorb all sellers regardless of their ability to determine current order flow activity.

##1700’s Work Around

It’s not the end of the world; just the world as we knew it is becoming the way the world was again.

From my readings of market history, in the early years speculators would push money into the markets both long and short to determine the direction of least resistance. They’d follow on with more money in the direction which moved better.  It had very little to do with the underlying realities of the assets until...

Until the price of an asset became so undervalued that it made sense for someone to buy the entire company.  Trading knowledge was effectively a blind art.  One would have very little concrete knowledge about the environment in which they operated other than what could be felt, until that indestructible level of support where humans stepped in saying this stock is cheap enough that I’ll buy every share which gets sold to me.

Today’s algorithms are designed to create short term confusion then break the bid pushing prices down to their indestructible level of support.  This is not new to smaller stocks, but it’s the first time mass market index investors are getting a look at the full downside ability of these algorithms. 

Today’s fundamental and technical analysis tools for equity valuation fail against algorithms. Bottoms are again found using tools in the arsenal of traders from the 1700’s. 

##Big Fish Eats Little Fish

We may be close but haven’t yet found the indestructible pricing level for oil and oil companies.  We found a solid bid level in the lower $70’s.  3 Tuesdays back, after hours, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange then raised margin rates causing the Thanksgiving Day Massacre. Oil stabilized the Tuesday thereafter.  

Once the humans went home, after hours again, the CME raised margin rates a second time driving further selling.  Oil held support and began trading up with strong momentum.  At $68 and rising, Saudi Arabia jawboned that oil should find support around $60.  The humans flinched, algorithms have had a clear, uncontested run at their vicious cycle.

Oil credit (high yield debt) has come under pressure. New drilling is grinding to a stop.  And we are now looking for that level of indestructible value.  At what price will humans collectively absorb all selling?

This time it’s a little more complex.  The willful destructive actions and jawboning are about freeing up assets from the hands of smaller players who’ve borrowed billions for barren cow pastures.  At some point, debt has to be repaid or assets get liquidated into the hands of stronger buyers. As OPEC jawbones that their production will stay high regardless of price, pay particular attention to who acquires the fire-sale oil assets.

My buttons and zippers are still made out of plastic. Oil is not going away.  As production shuts down the surviving oil industry consolidators will offer huge returns.

##Culling of the Arrogancia

If you haven’t caught the theme by now… if an asset has excess value in its pricing, that pricing froth will get wrung out.  This means most of what we see in the public markets have to get back to a very sober price which reflects the underlying value of the company to someone who would actually want to buy the entire company.

It is if, then, else computer logic.  We can get our arms around it.  We can deal with it. 

In speaking with acquaintances who are well above the 1%, the word deflation is used in an academic conceptual context.  There is a broad disconnect with internalizing the economic realities of this world.  

From the bottom of the totem pole, it’s not seen as “deflation”.  It’s seen as the cessation of the Arrogacia’s predatory abuse of the working class.  In the past 15 years, US manufacturing wages have been reset to $15 per hour.  At the same time, gasoline has gone from $1.25 per gallon to $4.  Milk from $1 to $4. Sh…tuff hit the fan and the Arrogancia crammed down open credit card balances while subsequently enslaving all bankruptcy petitioners.   

As the bids crack, the new economic level of activity is likely to reflect what consumers have the ability or willingness to spend. The Arrogancia waxes “deflation”.  To the 99.7% it’s not deflation; it’s “We hope you enjoy your journey down to the functionality you have foisted upon us.” Welcome to the abyss your unsustainable short term gluttony has selfishly created.

Crass as it reads, that’s your landscape.  Investments need to be selected with respect to the above.  What’s new that can survive selling into this level of consumer purchasing power?  McDonald’s $2 hamburgers are too expensive now.

Which companies are not going to fall subject to working class disdain? In specific, the consumer is very sober. To get a dime out of the pocket of people with dimes in their pocket, the product or service must provide value.

As the wage collapse illustrates, Jimmy Hoffa’s union model has withered.  Filling the void is the instant truth dissemination of mass electronic communications. The social union of instant electronic communication is the new working class solidarity network.  Upcoming generations all intuitively expect to thumb up or down right or wrong, truth or falsehood. Exploiters and predators are shunned. 

The Arrogancia can no longer expect to survive on their position provided by birth and associations formed along their shepherded life path alone. 

Stewardship is the character trait of the future successful.

##Going Forward

For managed accounts, we’re focusing on staying positioned very conservatively while looking for opportunities which comply with “Stewardship” that are priced at indestructible levels of support.
In terms of length of time, think this index selloff resolves itself sooner than many expect. The holidays traditionally bring lower trading volumes.  Algorithms get most of their downside price movement executed during periods where volume goes weak.  The depth of the selloff, in my mind goes to whether the central banks intervene. Without intervention, we’ll get to the indestructible level of pricing rather expeditiously.  Then we can get back to establishing long term positions. 

Happy Holidays.
