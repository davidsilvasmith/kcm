This market has gone from “getting soft” over the past several months as the dollar has begun to gain strength, to very little is working and many positions have to be closed or trimmed back in size. The focus is shifting towards capital preservation.

Managed accounts are holding levels of cash that are extraordinarily high.  This down move has started in bonds and has moved into equities driven by a quickly rising dollar. 

## Your Strong Dollar and You

Most people get “inflation” meaning prices are going up because the US Dollar is going down in value, or the government is printing EVEN MORE money.  Inflation = higher gas prices because the dollar’s buying power is getting weaker, hence “weak dollar”.   This works the other way too.  A strengthening dollar or the dollar going up in value can happen for many reasons. When this happens oil gets cheaper, commodities get cheaper. We can buy more stuff with the dollar.  Prices go down on a lot of things including stocks and bonds.

The important relationship with a stronger dollar that needs to be discussed is the relationship between a stronger dollar and bonds.  Taking that one step further, a stronger dollar means higher interest rates or vice versa, rising interest rates can bring a stronger dollar.

There are a multitude of reasons why the dollar can “get stronger” or go up in value.  The Fed can put fewer dollars into the system, ending QE. Other countries can print a ton of their currency thus making the dollar more valuable by comparison because theirs is getting weaker, just as Japan, China, and Europe are doing right now.  Investors may abandon another nation’s currency because they are uncertain about upcoming political events as we are seeing happen to the British pound due to Scotland’s upcoming independence vote; this drives the pound down and the dollar higher as well.  The Fed can raise interest rates making it more expensive to borrow money thus driving up the demand for dollars; which is on the horizon.  Or we can end a 32 year long bull market in bonds by having investors collectively realize all at once that getting 2% or less in interest really isn’t very good.  

My children had inherited some treasuries paying 8%.  This bull market in bonds started when mortgage holders were paying around 18%.  This means we have to reset to somewhere between 3% and 18% for mortgages.  

Depending on who you are, this relationships is a virtuous or a vicious circle.  If you are an investor who equates bonds with financial safety, this could turn into an internet bubble-esque vicious cycle.  For the people who don’t use debt this could become the ultimate virtuous circle.
 
## Slow Motion Rotation (cont.)

Last month I described the market as entering an existence of slow motion rotation.  The strengthening dollar is fueling that slow motion fire.

Bonds have started to get hit.

Oil has been taking pressure from this run by the dollar.  We’ll see if the Saudi’s cut production to try to hold up prices. Or maybe halting all US production in Russia, may help to put a floor under the price of oil.

Indexes this past week have begun to trade with an empty soft feel where moves up don’t want to stay up. In the S&P 500 we are seeing the start of a down trend; lower highs and lower lows.

## Going Forward

Plenty of crazy stuff happening in the world. Most of which brings upward pressure on the dollar.  For managed accounts, I’ve already taken a heavy position in dollars.  Now it’s a matter of monitoring and pruning our remaining longs while looking for either opportunities to add short positions or for evidence of the end of the selling in equities and bonds. 

I expect the bottom to be put in by economic responsiveness to the strengthening dollar.  Yes interest rates should rise.  This will allow banks to make riskier loans profitably; more lending for small businesses.  More lending means more jobs.  More jobs means more consumption. Which then means more shipping of goods.

But… we have to wade through this initial purge of weak dollar positions.

Be well,
