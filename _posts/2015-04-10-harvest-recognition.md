Hello Friends,

This week [HVST.com](http://www.hvst.com/) “Harvest”, the finance industry’s qualitative information exchange bestowed upon KCM the highest professional honor a firm can receive.  The respect of association.

As most of you are familiar, the securities industry is very concerned about not giving recommendations.  We are also by rule prohibitive of endorsements.  This leaves us with keeping professional distance from most people, and allowing a select few into our professional space passively extending credibility to those with whom we are willing to be seen.

After sharing the April 2015 KCM Investor Letter to HVSTt.com they extended to KCM, a little known small market manager, respect which can only be dreamed of by the most seasoned of firms.

First they’ve been kind enough to hold the KCM Investor Letter on their Recommended Reading List for over 1 week.  In this world, media content goes stale in moments.  As you read further to gain an understanding of Harvest, a week on Harvest’s recommended list is awe inspiring.

Over the past year KCM has shared other documents with the Harvest community along with having some solid getting acquainted conversations with Harvest COO Jeff Dorman, CFA and Khai Nguyen, Director of Business Development.

This week KCM’s pie logo, unbeknown to KCM prior, was added to Harvest’s background banner image including KCM with some of the industry’s most respected managers.  It’s important for me to reiterate that this is not an endorsement, nor a recommendation of our firm by Harvest.  But the proximity of our logo placement with respect to their name is the antithesis of distance.

Below are cuttings from this week’s finalternatives.com feature on Harvest.  It will provide a view as to the gravity of Harvest.
